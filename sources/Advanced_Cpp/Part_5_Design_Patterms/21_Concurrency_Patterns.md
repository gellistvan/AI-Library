## Chapter 21: Concurrency Patterns

In the realm of modern C++ programming, the ability to handle concurrent operations effectively is crucial for building high-performance and responsive applications. Concurrency patterns provide robust solutions to manage and synchronize multiple threads of execution, enabling developers to tackle complex problems in a structured and efficient manner. This chapter delves into four advanced concurrency patterns: the Active Object Pattern, which decouples method execution from invocation; the Monitor Object Pattern, which offers synchronization mechanisms to control access to shared resources; the Half-Sync/Half-Async Pattern, which facilitates the concurrent handling of requests; and the Thread Pool Pattern, which efficiently manages a pool of worker threads. Each pattern is explored in detail, providing insights into their implementation, benefits, and practical applications in C++ programming.

### 21.1. Active Object Pattern: Decoupling Method Execution from Invocation

The Active Object pattern is a concurrency pattern that decouples the method execution from its invocation. This separation allows for asynchronous method calls, enhancing the responsiveness of an application by offloading long-running operations to a separate thread. In this section, we will explore the Active Object pattern in detail, with a focus on its structure, implementation, and practical use cases in C++.

#### Structure of the Active Object Pattern

The Active Object pattern consists of several key components:

1. **Proxy**: The interface that clients interact with. It provides methods that clients call to request actions.
2. **Method Request**: An object that represents a method call. It encapsulates the action to be performed and its parameters.
3. **Scheduler**: A component that manages the queue of method requests and dispatches them to the appropriate threads for execution.
4. **Servant**: The actual object that performs the requested operations.
5. **Activation Queue**: A thread-safe queue that stores method requests until they are processed.
6. **Future**: An object that represents the result of an asynchronous computation, providing a way to retrieve the result once it is available.

#### Implementation in C++

Let's walk through a detailed implementation of the Active Object pattern in C++.

##### Step 1: Define the Proxy and Method Request

The Proxy class provides an interface for clients to interact with the Active Object. Each method in the Proxy class corresponds to a method request.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <future>
#include <queue>

#include <thread>
#include <condition_variable>

#include <functional>

class ActiveObject {
public:
    ActiveObject() {
        workerThread = std::thread(&ActiveObject::processQueue, this);
    }

    ~ActiveObject() {
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
            stop = true;
        }
        queueCondVar.notify_one();
        workerThread.join();
    }

    std::future<void> asyncMethod1(int param) {
        auto request = std::make_shared<MethodRequest<void>>([param]() {
            std::cout << "Executing Method 1 with param: " << param << std::endl;
        });
        enqueue(request);
        return request->getFuture();
    }

    std::future<int> asyncMethod2(int param) {
        auto request = std::make_shared<MethodRequest<int>>([param]() {
            std::cout << "Executing Method 2 with param: " << param << std::endl;
            return param * 2;
        });
        enqueue(request);
        return request->getFuture();
    }

private:
    template<typename R>
    class MethodRequest {
    public:
        MethodRequest(std::function<R()> func) : func(func) {}

        std::future<R> getFuture() {
            return promise.get_future();
        }

        void execute() {
            promise.set_value(func());
        }

    private:
        std::function<R()> func;
        std::promise<R> promise;
    };

    template<>
    class MethodRequest<void> {
    public:
        MethodRequest(std::function<void()> func) : func(func) {}

        std::future<void> getFuture() {
            return promise.get_future();
        }

        void execute() {
            func();
            promise.set_value();
        }

    private:
        std::function<void()> func;
        std::promise<void> promise;
    };

    void enqueue(std::shared_ptr<MethodRequest<void>> request) {
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
            requestQueue.push(request);
        }
        queueCondVar.notify_one();
    }

    void enqueue(std::shared_ptr<MethodRequest<int>> request) {
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
            requestQueue.push(request);
        }
        queueCondVar.notify_one();
    }

    void processQueue() {
        while (true) {
            std::shared_ptr<MethodRequest<void>> request;
            {
                std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
                queueCondVar.wait(lock, [this] { return !requestQueue.empty() || stop; });
                if (stop && requestQueue.empty()) {
                    return;
                }
                request = requestQueue.front();
                requestQueue.pop();
            }
            request->execute();
        }
    }

    std::thread workerThread;
    std::mutex queueMutex;
    std::condition_variable queueCondVar;
    std::queue<std::shared_ptr<MethodRequest<void>>> requestQueue;
    bool stop = false;
};
```

##### Step 2: Use the Active Object

Now that we have defined the Active Object, let's use it in a simple application.

```cpp
int main() {
    ActiveObject activeObject;

    auto future1 = activeObject.asyncMethod1(10);
    auto future2 = activeObject.asyncMethod2(20);

    future1.get(); // Wait for Method 1 to complete
    int result = future2.get(); // Wait for Method 2 to complete and get the result

    std::cout << "Result of Method 2: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

In this implementation, the `ActiveObject` class encapsulates the logic for asynchronous method execution. The `asyncMethod1` and `asyncMethod2` methods create method requests and enqueue them for processing. The `MethodRequest` class template handles both void and non-void return types, ensuring flexibility in method call handling.

The `processQueue` method runs in a separate thread, continuously processing method requests from the queue. This decouples the method execution from its invocation, allowing the main thread to remain responsive while the worker thread handles the actual execution of methods.

#### Advantages of the Active Object Pattern

1. **Asynchronous Execution**: Methods can be called asynchronously, improving the responsiveness of the application.
2. **Decoupling**: The pattern decouples method invocation from execution, allowing for better separation of concerns.
3. **Thread Safety**: The activation queue and the worker thread ensure that method requests are processed in a thread-safe manner.
4. **Scalability**: The pattern can be extended to support multiple worker threads, enhancing scalability for handling a large number of requests.

#### Practical Applications

The Active Object pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where:

1. **UI Applications**: Long-running operations can be offloaded to a background thread, preventing the UI from freezing.
2. **Network Servers**: Handling multiple client requests asynchronously improves the server's responsiveness and throughput.
3. **Real-time Systems**: Decoupling time-sensitive tasks from the main control loop ensures that critical operations are not delayed.

By leveraging the Active Object pattern, C++ developers can build robust and efficient concurrent applications, enhancing both performance and user experience.

### 21.2. Monitor Object Pattern: Synchronization Mechanisms

The Monitor Object pattern is a synchronization pattern that provides a mechanism to ensure that only one thread at a time can execute a method on an object. This pattern is particularly useful for protecting shared resources from concurrent access issues, such as race conditions and deadlocks. In this section, we will delve into the Monitor Object pattern in detail, focusing on its structure, implementation, and practical use cases in C++.

#### Structure of the Monitor Object Pattern

The Monitor Object pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Monitor Object**: The object whose methods are protected by mutual exclusion. It encapsulates the shared resource and provides synchronized access to it.
2. **Mutex**: A mutual exclusion lock that ensures only one thread can execute a method on the monitor object at a time.
3. **Condition Variables**: Used to manage the waiting and signaling of threads based on certain conditions within the monitor object.

#### Implementation in C++

Let's explore a detailed implementation of the Monitor Object pattern in C++.

##### Step 1: Define the Monitor Object

The Monitor Object class encapsulates the shared resource and provides synchronized methods to access and modify it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

#include <condition_variable>
#include <vector>

#include <chrono>

class MonitorObject {
public:
    MonitorObject() : value(0) {}

    void increment() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        ++value;
        std::cout << "Value incremented to " << value << " by thread " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
        condVar.notify_all();
    }

    void waitForValue(int target) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        condVar.wait(lock, [this, target] { return value >= target; });
        std::cout << "Target value " << target << " reached by thread " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
    }

    int getValue() const {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        return value;
    }

private:
    mutable std::mutex mutex;
    std::condition_variable condVar;
    int value;
};
```

##### Step 2: Use the Monitor Object

Let's see how the Monitor Object can be used in a multithreaded application.

```cpp
void incrementTask(MonitorObject& monitor) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
        monitor.increment();
    }
}

void waitTask(MonitorObject& monitor, int target) {
    monitor.waitForValue(target);
}

int main() {
    MonitorObject monitor;

    std::thread t1(incrementTask, std::ref(monitor));
    std::thread t2(waitTask, std::ref(monitor), 3);
    std::thread t3(waitTask, std::ref(monitor), 5);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

In this implementation, the `MonitorObject` class encapsulates a shared resource (an integer `value`) and provides synchronized access to it using a mutex and a condition variable. The `increment` method increments the value and notifies all waiting threads. The `waitForValue` method allows threads to wait until the value reaches a specified target.

The `incrementTask` function increments the value of the monitor object multiple times, while the `waitTask` function waits for the value to reach a specified target. In the `main` function, multiple threads are created to demonstrate concurrent access to the monitor object.

#### Advanced Implementation: Producer-Consumer Example

To further illustrate the Monitor Object pattern, let's implement a classic producer-consumer problem using this pattern.

```cpp
class MonitorBuffer {
public:
    MonitorBuffer(size_t size) : size(size), count(0), front(0), rear(0), buffer(size) {}

    void produce(int item) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        condVarNotFull.wait(lock, [this] { return count < size; });

        buffer[rear] = item;
        rear = (rear + 1) % size;
        ++count;
        std::cout << "Produced " << item << " by thread " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;

        condVarNotEmpty.notify_all();
    }

    int consume() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        condVarNotEmpty.wait(lock, [this] { return count > 0; });

        int item = buffer[front];
        front = (front + 1) % size;
        --count;
        std::cout << "Consumed " << item << " by thread " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;

        condVarNotFull.notify_all();
        return item;
    }

private:
    size_t size;
    size_t count;
    size_t front;
    size_t rear;
    std::vector<int> buffer;
    std::mutex mutex;
    std::condition_variable condVarNotFull;
    std::condition_variable condVarNotEmpty;
};

void producerTask(MonitorBuffer& buffer, int items) {
    for (int i = 0; i < items; ++i) {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
        buffer.produce(i);
    }
}

void consumerTask(MonitorBuffer& buffer, int items) {
    for (int i = 0; i < items; ++i) {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(150));
        buffer.consume();
    }
}

int main() {
    MonitorBuffer buffer(10);

    std::thread producer1(producerTask, std::ref(buffer), 20);
    std::thread producer2(producerTask, std::ref(buffer), 20);
    std::thread consumer1(consumerTask, std::ref(buffer), 20);
    std::thread consumer2(consumerTask, std::ref(buffer), 20);

    producer1.join();
    producer2.join();
    consumer1.join();
    consumer2.join();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

In this advanced example, the `MonitorBuffer` class represents a shared buffer with a fixed size. The `produce` method adds an item to the buffer, while the `consume` method removes an item from the buffer. Both methods use condition variables to manage waiting and signaling based on the buffer's state (full or empty).

The `producerTask` and `consumerTask` functions simulate producers and consumers that add and remove items from the buffer, respectively. In the `main` function, multiple producer and consumer threads are created to demonstrate concurrent access to the buffer.

#### Advantages of the Monitor Object Pattern

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Ensures that only one thread can execute a method on the monitor object at a time, preventing race conditions.
2. **Condition Synchronization**: Condition variables allow threads to wait for certain conditions to be met, providing a flexible synchronization mechanism.
3. **Encapsulation**: The monitor object encapsulates the shared resource and the synchronization logic, promoting modular and maintainable code.
4. **Thread Safety**: By using mutexes and condition variables, the monitor object provides thread-safe access to shared resources.

#### Practical Applications

The Monitor Object pattern is widely used in scenarios where:

1. **Shared Resources**: Multiple threads need synchronized access to shared resources, such as in database connections, file handling, and hardware interfaces.
2. **Producer-Consumer Problems**: Coordinating the production and consumption of items between multiple threads.
3. **Thread Coordination**: Managing complex thread interactions, such as in real-time systems and event-driven architectures.

By leveraging the Monitor Object pattern, C++ developers can effectively manage concurrent access to shared resources, ensuring the correctness and stability of multithreaded applications.

### 21.3. Half-Sync/Half-Async Pattern: Concurrent Handling of Requests

The Half-Sync/Half-Async pattern is a concurrency pattern that decouples synchronous and asynchronous processing in a system. This separation allows a clear distinction between the synchronous and asynchronous layers, enabling efficient and manageable concurrent handling of requests. In this section, we will explore the Half-Sync/Half-Async pattern in detail, focusing on its structure, implementation, and practical use cases in C++.

#### Structure of the Half-Sync/Half-Async Pattern

The Half-Sync/Half-Async pattern typically consists of three layers:

1. **Asynchronous Layer**: Handles asynchronous operations, such as I/O operations or event handling. It often uses non-blocking techniques and event-driven mechanisms.
2. **Queueing Layer**: Acts as a bridge between the asynchronous and synchronous layers. It buffers requests from the asynchronous layer and passes them to the synchronous layer.
3. **Synchronous Layer**: Handles the business logic and processing of requests in a synchronous manner. It operates in a blocking fashion, often using threads to process requests concurrently.

#### Implementation in C++

Let's walk through a detailed implementation of the Half-Sync/Half-Async pattern in C++.

##### Step 1: Define the Asynchronous Layer

The Asynchronous Layer will handle non-blocking operations and push tasks to a queue.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

#include <condition_variable>
#include <queue>

#include <functional>
#include <atomic>

#include <chrono>

class AsyncLayer {
public:
    AsyncLayer() : stop(false) {
        asyncThread = std::thread(&AsyncLayer::run, this);
    }

    ~AsyncLayer() {
        stop = true;
        if (asyncThread.joinable()) {
            asyncThread.join();
        }
    }

    void postTask(const std::function<void()>& task) {
        {
            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
            taskQueue.push(task);
        }
        queueCondVar.notify_one();
    }

private:
    void run() {
        while (!stop) {
            std::function<void()> task;
            {
                std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
                queueCondVar.wait(lock, [this] { return !taskQueue.empty() || stop; });
                if (stop && taskQueue.empty()) {
                    return;
                }
                task = taskQueue.front();
                taskQueue.pop();
            }
            task();
        }
    }

    std::thread asyncThread;
    std::mutex queueMutex;
    std::condition_variable queueCondVar;
    std::queue<std::function<void()>> taskQueue;
    std::atomic<bool> stop;
};
```

##### Step 2: Define the Queueing Layer

The Queueing Layer will manage the buffer between the asynchronous and synchronous layers.

```cpp
class QueueingLayer {
public:
    void addRequest(const std::function<void()>& request) {
        {
            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
            requestQueue.push(request);
        }
        queueCondVar.notify_one();
    }

    std::function<void()> getRequest() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
        queueCondVar.wait(lock, [this] { return !requestQueue.empty(); });
        auto request = requestQueue.front();
        requestQueue.pop();
        return request;
    }

private:
    std::mutex queueMutex;
    std::condition_variable queueCondVar;
    std::queue<std::function<void()>> requestQueue;
};
```

##### Step 3: Define the Synchronous Layer

The Synchronous Layer will handle processing requests in a blocking manner using a pool of worker threads.

```cpp
class SyncLayer {
public:
    SyncLayer(QueueingLayer& queueLayer, int numThreads) : queueLayer(queueLayer), stop(false) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
            workerThreads.emplace_back(&SyncLayer::processRequests, this);
        }
    }

    ~SyncLayer() {
        stop = true;
        for (auto& thread : workerThreads) {
            if (thread.joinable()) {
                thread.join();
            }
        }
    }

private:
    void processRequests() {
        while (!stop) {
            auto request = queueLayer.getRequest();
            request();
        }
    }

    QueueingLayer& queueLayer;
    std::vector<std::thread> workerThreads;
    std::atomic<bool> stop;
};
```

##### Step 4: Integrate the Layers

Let's integrate the three layers into a cohesive application.

```cpp
void asyncOperation(QueueingLayer& queueLayer) {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
    queueLayer.addRequest([]() {
        std::cout << "Processing request by thread " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
    });
}

int main() {
    QueueingLayer queueLayer;
    AsyncLayer asyncLayer;
    SyncLayer syncLayer(queueLayer, 4);

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        asyncLayer.postTask([&queueLayer]() { asyncOperation(queueLayer); });
    }

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

In this implementation, the `AsyncLayer` class handles asynchronous operations, posting tasks to a queue. The `QueueingLayer` class acts as a bridge, buffering requests and passing them to the `SyncLayer` for processing. The `SyncLayer` class processes requests synchronously using a pool of worker threads.

The `asyncOperation` function simulates an asynchronous operation that adds a request to the queue. In the `main` function, we create instances of the `QueueingLayer`, `AsyncLayer`, and `SyncLayer` classes, and post multiple tasks to the `AsyncLayer`.

#### Advantages of the Half-Sync/Half-Async Pattern

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separates asynchronous I/O operations from synchronous request processing, making the system more manageable and maintainable.
2. **Scalability**: The asynchronous layer can handle a large number of events without blocking, while the synchronous layer can be scaled with additional worker threads to handle increased load.
3. **Responsiveness**: By offloading long-running tasks to a separate layer, the system remains responsive to new incoming requests.

#### Practical Applications

The Half-Sync/Half-Async pattern is widely used in scenarios where:

1. **Network Servers**: Handling numerous incoming connections and requests asynchronously, with synchronous processing of each request.
2. **GUI Applications**: Managing user interactions asynchronously while performing background tasks synchronously.
3. **Real-time Systems**: Ensuring real-time responsiveness by decoupling time-critical asynchronous events from synchronous processing.

By leveraging the Half-Sync/Half-Async pattern, C++ developers can build efficient and scalable systems capable of handling a high volume of concurrent requests while maintaining responsiveness and manageability.

### 21.4. Thread Pool Pattern: Managing a Pool of Worker Threads

The Thread Pool pattern is a concurrency pattern that manages a pool of worker threads to efficiently handle a large number of short-lived tasks. By reusing existing threads instead of creating and destroying them for each task, the pattern improves performance and resource utilization. In this section, we will explore the Thread Pool pattern in detail, focusing on its structure, implementation, and practical use cases in C++.

#### Structure of the Thread Pool Pattern

The Thread Pool pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Thread Pool Manager**: Manages the pool of worker threads, including creating, starting, and stopping threads.
2. **Worker Threads**: The threads that perform the actual work. They wait for tasks to be assigned, execute them, and then return to waiting.
3. **Task Queue**: A thread-safe queue that stores tasks to be executed by the worker threads.
4. **Tasks**: The units of work that are submitted to the thread pool for execution.

#### Implementation in C++

Let's walk through a detailed implementation of the Thread Pool pattern in C++.

##### Step 1: Define the Thread Pool Manager

The Thread Pool Manager class manages the lifecycle of worker threads and the task queue.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

#include <condition_variable>
#include <queue>

#include <functional>
#include <vector>

#include <atomic>

class ThreadPool {
public:
    ThreadPool(size_t numThreads) : stop(false) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
            workers.emplace_back(&ThreadPool::worker, this);
        }
    }

    ~ThreadPool() {
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
            stop = true;
        }
        condition.notify_all();
        for (std::thread &worker : workers) {
            if (worker.joinable()) {
                worker.join();
            }
        }
    }

    void enqueueTask(const std::function<void()>& task) {
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
            tasks.push(task);
        }
        condition.notify_one();
    }

private:
    void worker() {
        while (true) {
            std::function<void()> task;
            {
                std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
                condition.wait(lock, [this] { return stop || !tasks.empty(); });
                if (stop && tasks.empty()) {
                    return;
                }
                task = std::move(tasks.front());
                tasks.pop();
            }
            task();
        }
    }

    std::vector<std::thread> workers;
    std::queue<std::function<void()>> tasks;
    std::mutex queueMutex;
    std::condition_variable condition;
    std::atomic<bool> stop;
};
```

##### Step 2: Use the Thread Pool

Let's see how the Thread Pool can be used in a simple application.

```cpp
void exampleTask(int id) {
    std::cout << "Task " << id << " is being processed by thread " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
}

int main() {
    ThreadPool pool(4);

    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
        pool.enqueueTask([i] { exampleTask(i); });
    }

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

In this implementation, the `ThreadPool` class manages a pool of worker threads that execute tasks from a thread-safe queue. The `enqueueTask` method adds tasks to the queue, and the `worker` method executed by each worker thread continuously processes tasks from the queue.

The `exampleTask` function simulates a task that prints its ID and the thread ID that is processing it. In the `main` function, we create a thread pool with four worker threads and enqueue ten tasks for processing.

#### Advanced Implementation: Dynamic Thread Pool

To further illustrate the Thread Pool pattern, let's implement a dynamic thread pool that can adjust the number of worker threads based on the workload.

```cpp
class DynamicThreadPool {
public:
    DynamicThreadPool(size_t minThreads, size_t maxThreads)
        : minThreads(minThreads), maxThreads(maxThreads), stop(false) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < minThreads; ++i) {
            workers.emplace_back(&DynamicThreadPool::worker, this);
        }
    }

    ~DynamicThreadPool() {
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
            stop = true;
        }
        condition.notify_all();
        for (std::thread &worker : workers) {
            if (worker.joinable()) {
                worker.join();
            }
        }
    }

    void enqueueTask(const std::function<void()>& task) {
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
            tasks.push(task);
            if (workers.size() < maxThreads && tasks.size() > workers.size()) {
                workers.emplace_back(&DynamicThreadPool::worker, this);
            }
        }
        condition.notify_one();
    }

private:
    void worker() {
        while (true) {
            std::function<void()> task;
            {
                std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
                condition.wait(lock, [this] { return stop || !tasks.empty(); });
                if (stop && tasks.empty()) {
                    return;
                }
                task = std::move(tasks.front());
                tasks.pop();
            }
            task();
        }
    }

    size_t minThreads;
    size_t maxThreads;
    std::vector<std::thread> workers;
    std::queue<std::function<void()>> tasks;
    std::mutex queueMutex;
    std::condition_variable condition;
    std::atomic<bool> stop;
};
```

##### Using the Dynamic Thread Pool

Let's see how the Dynamic Thread Pool can be used in a simple application.

```cpp
void dynamicTask(int id) {
    std::cout << "Dynamic Task " << id << " is being processed by thread " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
}

int main() {
    DynamicThreadPool dynamicPool(2, 6);

    for (int i = 1; i <= 20; ++i) {
        dynamicPool.enqueueTask([i] { dynamicTask(i); });
    }

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(3));
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

In this advanced implementation, the `DynamicThreadPool` class can dynamically adjust the number of worker threads based on the workload. The constructor initializes a minimum number of threads, and the `enqueueTask` method adds tasks to the queue while potentially spawning new worker threads if the workload exceeds the current capacity and the maximum number of threads has not been reached.

The `dynamicTask` function simulates a task that prints its ID and the thread ID that is processing it. In the `main` function, we create a dynamic thread pool with a minimum of two and a maximum of six worker threads, and enqueue twenty tasks for processing.

#### Advantages of the Thread Pool Pattern

1. **Resource Efficiency**: Reuses existing threads for multiple tasks, reducing the overhead of thread creation and destruction.
2. **Scalability**: Can handle a large number of tasks by adjusting the number of worker threads based on the workload.
3. **Responsiveness**: Improves the responsiveness of applications by offloading tasks to a pool of worker threads.
4. **Load Management**: Balances the load among worker threads, ensuring efficient use of system resources.

#### Practical Applications

The Thread Pool pattern is widely used in scenarios where:

1. **Web Servers**: Handling numerous incoming requests concurrently without the overhead of creating a new thread for each request.
2. **Database Connections**: Managing a pool of database connections to efficiently handle multiple queries.
3. **Parallel Processing**: Distributing computational tasks across multiple threads to improve performance and responsiveness.
4. **Real-time Systems**: Ensuring timely processing of tasks by maintaining a pool of ready-to-run worker threads.

By leveraging the Thread Pool pattern, C++ developers can build efficient and scalable systems capable of handling a high volume of concurrent tasks while maintaining optimal performance and resource utilization.
