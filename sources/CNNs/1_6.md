### 6.1 LeNet-5

#### Introduction

LeNet-5, introduced by Yann LeCun and his colleagues in 1998, is one of the pioneering Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. It was specifically designed for handwritten digit recognition, crucially influencing the way neural networks are applied to image processing and computer vision tasks. This architecture laid the foundational concepts for modern CNNs, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, forming the building blocks for deeper and more complex structures that followed.

#### Architectural Composition

LeNet-5 follows a sequential architecture consisting of seven layers (including input and output layers but excluding the non-learnable layers like the activation functions). Here is a detailed breakdown of each layer:

1. **Input Layer**
   - **Dimensions:** 32x32 pixels, single channel (grayscale image).
   - LeNet-5 was originally designed for the MNIST dataset, where each image of a handwritten digit was centered within a 28x28 field. Zero-padding was used to extend these images to 32x32 dimensions, enabling convolution operations that preserve spatial dimensions better.

2. **C1 - First Convolutional Layer**
   - **Filter Size:** 5x5 (receptive field)
   - **Number of Filters:** 6
   - **Stride:** 1
   - **Activation Function:** Sigmoid (or tanh in some implementations)
   - **Output Dimensions:** 28x28x6
   - **Operation:** Each of the six 5x5 filters convolves across the input image, producing six feature maps. If $I$ is the input image of size $32 \times 32$ and $K$ is a filter of size $5 \times 5$, the convolution operation can be mathematically described as:
     $$
     (I * K)(i,j) = \sum_{m=0}^{4} \sum_{n=0}^{4} I(i+m, j+n) K(m,n)
     $$
   - **Purpose:** Captures low-level features such as edges and corners.

3. **S2 - First Subsampling (Pooling) Layer**
   - **Type:** Average pooling
   - **Filter Size:** 2x2
   - **Stride:** 2
   - **Output Dimensions:** 14x14x6
   - **Operation:** Reduces the dimensionality of each feature map while preserving important information. If $M$ is an activation map, average pooling can be described as:
     $$
     M'(i,j) = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{m=0}^{1} \sum_{n=0}^{1} M(2i+m, 2j+n)
     $$
   - **Purpose:** Reduces computational complexity and helps in achieving spatial invariance.

4. **C3 - Second Convolutional Layer**
   - **Filter Size:** 5x5
   - **Number of Filters:** 16
   - **Stride:** 1
   - **Activation Function:** Sigmoid (or tanh)
   - **Output Dimensions:** 10x10x16
   - **Operation:** Each of the 16 filters is connected to a unique subset of the $S2$ feature maps. This layer is not fully connected as each convolutional filter is only connected to a subset of the pooled feature maps from the previous layer. 
   - **Purpose:** Captures more complex features and patterns.

5. **S4 - Second Subsampling (Pooling) Layer**
   - **Type:** Average pooling
   - **Filter Size:** 2x2
   - **Stride:** 2
   - **Output Dimensions:** 5x5x16
   - **Operation:** Similar to S2, this layer further reduces the dimensionality.
   - **Purpose:** Further reduces computational complexity and enables the model to learn more abstract features.

6. **C5 - Third Convolutional Layer**
   - **Filter Size:** 5x5
   - **Number of Filters:** 120
   - **Stride:** 1
   - **Activation Function:** Sigmoid (or tanh)
   - **Output Dimensions:** 1x1x120 (flattened to a 1D vector of size 120)
   - **Operation:** This layer is fully connected to the entire 5x5x16 un-pooled feature maps from S4.
   - **Purpose:** Acts as a bridge between convolutional operations and the fully connected layers by reducing the spatial dimensions to a 1D vector, representing highly abstracted features.

7. **F6 - First Fully Connected Layer**
   - **Number of Neurons:** 84
   - **Activation Function:** Sigmoid (or tanh)
   - **Output Dimensions:** 84
   - **Operation:** This layer connects all 120 neurons from the previous layer to 84 neurons.
   - **Purpose:** Performs high-level reasoning based on the features learned by the convolutional layers.

8. **Output Layer**
   - **Number of Neurons:** 10
   - **Activation Function:** Softmax
   - **Output Dimensions:** 10
   - **Operation:** Produces a probability distribution over the 10 classes of the MNIST dataset.
   - **Purpose:** Outputs the final classification decision.

#### Training Procedure and Optimization

- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss, defined as:
  $$
  L = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \log(\hat{y_i})
  $$
  where $y_i$ is the true label, and $\hat{y_i}$ is the predicted probability for the $i$-th class.
  
- **Optimizer:** LeNet-5 originally used Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimization. Modern implementations might employ advanced optimizers like Adam or RMSprop for faster convergence.
  
- **Backpropagation:** Gradients are backpropagated through the network, adjusting weights using the chain rule of calculus to minimize the loss function iteratively.

#### Mathematical Background

Here, we delve into some fundamental mathematical concepts used in CNNs, particularly those in LeNet-5.
- **Convolution:** The convolution operation is defined as:
  $$
  (I * K)(i,j) = \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} I_{i+m, j+n} K_{m,n}
  $$
  Where $I$ is the input matrix, $K$ is the filter kernel, and $M$, $N$ are their respective dimensions.

- **Pooling:** Average pooling is defined as:
  $$
  P(i,j) = \frac{1}{|R|} \sum_{(m,n) \in R} M(m,n)
  $$
  where $P(i,j)$ is the pooled value, $R$ is the pooling region, and $M(m,n)$ are the pre-pooled values in that region. For 2x2 pooling, $|R|=4$.

- **Activation Functions:** 
    - **Sigmoid:** 
      $$
      \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
      $$
    - **Softmax:** 
      $$
      \sigma(z)_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
      $$
      Softmax functions provide probabilities for each class in a multi-class classification setting.

#### Implementation in Python (Simplified)

# Assuming 'x_train' and 'y_train' are preprocessed datasets:
# model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

#### Impact and Applications

LeNet-5 revolutionized the use of neural networks for image recognition tasks. Its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits had profound implications for automated systems in banking (for check processing) and the postal service (for zip code recognition). The architecture's principles have been absorbed and expanded upon in subsequent, more advanced networks such as AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet.

   - The choice of 3x3 convolutions stacked to replace larger receptive fields, specifically 7x7, e.g., two 3x3 convolutions stack to cover the same receptive field as one 5x5, but with fewer parameters and more non-linear activation functions inserted into the network for better feature learning.

#### Mathematical Background

  $$
  L(y, \hat{y}) = - \sum_{i} y_i \log(\hat{y_i})
  $$
  Where $y_i$ represents the binary indicator (0 or 1) if the class label is the correct classification for the input and $\hat{y_i}$ is the predicted probability.

    $$

  $$
  $$

### 6.5 ResNet

#### Introduction

Deep learning has witnessed remarkable advancements, but as networks grow deeper, they encounter the vanishing gradient problem, making training significantly more challenging. ResNet, short for Residual Network, proposed by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun in 2015, addressed this issue by introducing residual connections. ResNet won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2015 with an impressive top-5 error rate of 3.57%. The novel architecture of ResNet, featuring skip connections, made it possible to train extraordinarily deep networks with improved accuracy and efficiency.

#### Architectural Composition

The fundamental building block of ResNet is the residual block, which introduces an identity mapping that bypasses one or more layers. This composition can be extended to create networks of varying depths, including ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152.

1. **Basic Residual Block**

The simplest form of a residual block comprises two convolutional layers with an identity shortcut that skips these layers. In deeper variants, bottleneck architectures are used to make computations more efficient.

**Residual Block without Bottleneck (Used in ResNet-18 and ResNet-34):**

```
Input -> Conv2D -> BatchNorm -> ReLU -> Conv2D -> BatchNorm -> Addition -> ReLU -> Output
 |_________________________________________________________________________|
                                 skip connection
```

- **Conv2D:** Convolutional layer with a kernel size of 3x3, same padding, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.
- **Addition:** The input (identity) is added to the output of the second convolutional layer.
- **ReLU:** Activation function applied after merging the identity connection to introduce non-linearity.

#### Training Procedure and Optimization

**Dataset:**
- Trained on the ImageNet dataset comprising over a million images categorized into 1000 classes.

**Loss Function:**
- Cross-entropy loss:
  $$
  L = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \log(\hat{y_i})
  $$
  where $y_i$ is the true label, and $\hat{y_i}$ is the predicted probability for the $i$-th class.

**Regularization:**
- Batch normalization in each layer.
- Weight decay (e.g., $10^{-4}$).

#### Innovations Introduced by ResNet

1. **Residual Connections:**
   - Address the vanishing gradient problem by introducing identity shortcuts that bypass one or more layers, allowing gradients to propagate more effortlessly.
   $$
   \mathbf{y} = \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}, \{W_i\}) + \mathbf{x}
   $$
   where $\mathbf{y}$ is the output of the residual block, $\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}, \{W_i\})$ represents the function learning residual mapping, and $\mathbf{x}$ is the input.

2. **Deeper Networks:**
   - Demonstrated that very deep networks (up to 152 layers in their experiments) can be effectively trained without performance degradation, leading to significant performance gains.

3. **Bottleneck Layers:**
   - Used in deeper versions like ResNet-50 and beyond, to reduce the number of parameters while preserving network depth and representational power.

4. **Batch Normalization:**
   - Standardizes the inputs to each layer, accelerating training and providing regularization to reduce overfitting.

#### Mathematical Background

**Cross-Entropy Loss:**
$$
L(y, \hat{y}) = - \sum_{i} y_i \log(\hat{y_i})
$$
Where $y_i$ represents the binary indicator (0 or 1) if the class label is the correct classification for the input, and $\hat{y_i}$ is the predicted probability.

**Pooling Operation:**
- **Max Pooling:**
  $$
  P_{max}(x, y) = \max_{i, j \in R(x,y)} M(i, j)
  $$
  where $P_{max}(x, y)$ is the pooled value, and $R$ is the receptive field.

- **Average Pooling:**
  $$
  P_{avg}(x, y) = \frac{1}{|R|} \sum_{i, j \in R(x,y)} M(i, j)
  $$
  where $P_{avg}(x, y)$ is the average pooled value.

**SGD with Momentum:**
$$
v_{t+1} = \mu v_t - \eta \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)
$$
$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + v_{t+1}
$$
Where $v$ is the velocity, $\mu$ is the momentum coefficient, $\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)$ is the gradient of the loss $J$.

**Batch Normalization:**
- Reduces internal covariate shift by normalizing activations:
  $$
  \hat{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mathbb{E}[x_i]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[x_i] + \epsilon}}
  $$
  Scale and shift parameters ($\gamma, \beta$) are learnable, restoring the representation capability:
  $$
  y_i = \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta
  $$
