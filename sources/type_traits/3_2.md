## 12. Implementing Policies

As we venture into the realm of Policy-Based Design, understanding the intricacies of implementing policies is the linchpin of mastering this powerful paradigm. Policies are the modular components that define and customize the behavior of template classes or functions, allowing for unparalleled flexibility and reuse. This chapter breaks down the critical process of crafting basic policy classes, elucidating the methods to seamlessly combine them for richer functionalities, and demonstrates their practical applications through concrete examples. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a robust toolkit for designing flexible and maintainable C++ code bases, leveraging the true potential of policies to tailor components precisely to your requirements.

### Basic Policy Classes

Policy-Based Design (PBD) is a powerful and flexible design strategy in C++ that enhances code reuse, configurability, and separation of concerns. Fundamental to PBD is the concept of policiesâ€”modular, interchangeable components that define specific behaviors. In this chapter, we will delve deeply into the construction and utilization of basic policy classes, providing both a theoretical foundation and practical insights.

#### Definition and Role of Policies

Policies are template parameters that define behavior or characteristics for template classes or functions. They encapsulate independent, reusable elements of a design or algorithm, enabling a high degree of customization without altering the primary structure. Unlike inheritance and traditional design patterns, which can be rigid and complex, PBD with policies allows for more flexible and maintainable code.

#### Key Characteristics of Policy Classes

1. **Modularity**: Policies encapsulate self-contained units of functionality.
2. **Interchangeability**: Different policies can be swapped to alter behavior without changing the underlying code.
3. **Type-Safe Customization**: By using C++'s template mechanism, policies ensure type-safe manipulation of behaviors.
4. **Decoupling**: Policies help separate the core logic from specific behaviors, reducing dependencies and enhancing maintainability.

#### Designing Basic Policy Classes

In Policy-Based Design, policies are typically implemented as template parameters. These parameters can be classes or compile-time constants. Let's consider some foundational steps and principles in designing these policy classes.

##### Step 1: Identify Granular Behaviors

Start by identifying behaviors that can be abstracted as policies. For instance, in a container class, policies might govern:

- Memory allocation
- Iteration logic
- Error handling
- Thread-safety

##### Step 2: Define Policy Interfaces

Policy interfaces specify the contract that each policy must adhere to. These interfaces are often expressed as a set of member functions that policy classes must implement. The use of static polymorphism via templates allows policies to be checked and enforced at compile time.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MemoryAllocationPolicy {
public:
    static T* allocate(size_t n);
    static void deallocate(T* p, size_t n);
};
```

##### Step 3: Implement Concrete Policies

Concrete policies implement the defined interfaces, providing specific behaviors. Let's illustrate this concept with different memory allocation strategies.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class StandardAllocPolicy {
public:
    static T* allocate(size_t n) {
        return static_cast<T*>(::operator new(n * sizeof(T)));
    }

    static void deallocate(T* p, size_t n) {
        ::operator delete(p);
    }
};

template <typename T>
class PoolAllocPolicy {
public:
    static T* allocate(size_t n) {
        // Implement a custom memory pool allocation strategy.
    }

    static void deallocate(T* p, size_t n) {
        // Implement corresponding deallocation.
    }
};
```

##### Step 4: Integrate Policies with Host Classes

The host class (e.g., a container) will accept one or more policies as template parameters. This allows for the seamless integration of different behaviors without code modification.

```cpp
template <
    typename T,
    template <typename> class AllocPolicy = StandardAllocPolicy
>
class MyContainer : private AllocPolicy<T> {
    // Use AllocPolicy functions to manage memory
};
```

#### Policy Traits and Meta-programming

One advanced technique in policy-based design is using traits and meta-programming to introspect and manipulate policies. Traits classes and `std::type_traits` can be employed to query capabilities and properties of policies at compile-time. This enhances the flexibility and robustness of the design.

```cpp
template <typename Policy>
class HasAllocateMethod {
private:
    template <typename U>
    static auto test(int) -> decltype(
        std::declval<U>().allocate(0),
        std::true_type());

    template <typename>
    static std::false_type test(...);

public:
    static constexpr bool value = decltype(test<Policy>(0))::value;
};
```

Using such traits, the host class can conditionally compile features based on the capabilities of the provided policies. For example, optimal allocation strategies might be selected dynamically by inspecting if a policy supports custom allocation methods.

#### Combining Policies

One common scenario in Policy-Based Design is combining multiple policies to handle different aspects of behavior. This is typically achieved by nesting policy parameters or using a policy host class that aggregates multiple policies.

##### Composition of Policies

Consider a scenario where a container class needs to handle both memory allocation and error handling. These can be specified as separate policies:

```cpp
template <
    typename T,
    template <typename> class AllocPolicy,
    template <typename> class ErrorPolicy
>
class MyContainer : private AllocPolicy<T>, private ErrorPolicy<T> {
    // Integrate behaviors from both AllocPolicy and ErrorPolicy.
};
```

##### Policy Hosts

Policy hosts aggregate multiple policies and provide a single interface to the host class. This aids in managing the complexity and ensuring clean interaction between policies.

```cpp
template <typename T, typename AllocPolicy, typename ErrorPolicy>
class PolicyHost : public AllocPolicy, public ErrorPolicy {
public:
    using AllocPolicy::allocate;
    using AllocPolicy::deallocate;
    using ErrorPolicy::handleError;
    // Additional composite behavior.
};
```

#### Best Practices in Policy-Based Design

1. **Clear Documentation**: Each policy and their interfaces should be well-documented to ensure ease of use.
2. **Minimal Interfaces**: Define minimal, necessary interfaces for each policy to keep them lightweight and focused.
3. **Consistency**: Policies should follow consistent naming and structural conventions to ease composition and reuse.
4. **Testing**: Each policy should be independently testable. Use a combination of unit testing and compile-time assertions to ensure reliability.

#### Practical Examples

To solidify our understanding, let's look at two practical examples:

1. **Custom Allocator with Logging**: A container using a custom memory allocation policy that logs each allocation and deallocation.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class LoggingAllocPolicy {
public:
    static T* allocate(size_t n) {
        T* p = static_cast<T*>(::operator new(n * sizeof(T)));
        std::cout << "Allocating " << n << " elements at " << p << std::endl;
        return p;
    }
    static void deallocate(T* p, size_t n) {
        std::cout << "Deallocating " << n << " elements at " << p << std::endl;
        ::operator delete(p);
    }
};

template <
    typename T,
    template <typename> class AllocPolicy = LoggingAllocPolicy
>
class LoggingContainer : private AllocPolicy<T> {
    // Use AllocPolicy functions to manage memory
};
```

2. **Policy for Thread Safety**: A container with a thread-safety policy using locks to manage concurrent access.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class ThreadSafePolicy {
public:
    mutable std::mutex mtx;

    void lock() const {
        mtx.lock();
    }

    void unlock() const {
        mtx.unlock();
    }
};

template <
    typename T,
    template <typename> class LockPolicy = ThreadSafePolicy
>
class ThreadSafeContainer : private LockPolicy<T> {
public:
    void threadSafeOperation() {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(LockPolicy<T>::mtx);
        // Thread-safe operations here
    }
};
```

#### Summary

Basic policy classes are the building blocks of Policy-Based Design, allowing the creation of flexible and customizable software components. By adhering to the principles of modularity, interchangeability, and separation of concerns, policies enable developers to build robust and maintainable code. Understanding how to define, implement, and integrate these basic policy classes is essential for leveraging the full power of Policy-Based Design in C++. Through careful design and thoughtful composition of policies, programmers can address complex behavior requirements and create highly adaptable systems.

### Combining Policies

In the realm of Policy-Based Design, the true power and flexibility often emerge from the ability to combine multiple policies seamlessly. Combining policies allows for the creation of sophisticated and highly customizable software components while retaining modularity and ease of maintenance. This chapter will meticulously explore the methods and best practices for combining policies, delve into composition techniques, and illustrate the concepts with detailed examples. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively manage and leverage multiple policies in C++.

#### Introduction to Policy Combination

Combining policies involves integrating multiple independent policy classes into a single cohesive unit. This approach enables complex behavior by assembling simple, single-responsibility policies, each addressing a specific aspect of the functionality. Key benefits of combining policies include:

1. **Enhanced Modularization**: Each policy remains focused on a single responsibility, easing maintenance and reducing complexity.
2. **Improved Reusability**: Individual policies can be reused across different parts of a codebase or in different projects.
3. **Customization**: Combining policies dynamically alters the behavior of the main class or function without modifying its core logic.

#### Strategies for Combining Policies

Several strategies can be adopted when combining policies, each with its own merits and use cases. These strategies include policy composition, policy layers, and policy hosts.

##### Policy Composition

Policy composition involves directly integrating multiple policies into a primary class via inheritance or aggregation. This can be achieved using template parameters to accept multiple policy classes.

1. **Template Parameter Inheritance**: The primary class inherits from multiple policy classes, each providing different behaviors or functionality.

```cpp
template <typename T, typename PolicyA, typename PolicyB>
class CompositeClass : private PolicyA, private PolicyB {
public:
    void function() {
        PolicyA::methodA();
        PolicyB::methodB();
    }
};
```

2. **Aggregation via Member Variables**: Policies are aggregated as member variables within the primary class, allowing for a more explicit control of their interactions.

```cpp
template <typename T, typename PolicyA, typename PolicyB>
class AggregateClass {
    PolicyA policyA;
    PolicyB policyB;
public:
    void function() {
        policyA.methodA();
        policyB.methodB();
    }
};
```

##### Policy Layers

Policy layers create a hierarchy of policies where each layer builds on the previous one. This cascading approach allows for incremental addition of behaviors.

1. **Layered Inheritance**: Each policy layer inherits from the previous layer, extending or modifying its behavior.

```cpp
template <typename Policy>
class Layer1 : public Policy {
    void functionLayer1() {
        Policy::baseFunction();
        // Additional behavior
    }
};

template <typename Policy>
class Layer2 : public Layer1<Policy> {
    void functionLayer2() {
        Layer1<Policy>::functionLayer1();
        // Further behavior
    }
};
```

2. **Wrapper Policies**: Wrapper classes encapsulate policies, adding additional behavior without altering the original policy.

```cpp
template <typename Policy>
class WrapperPolicy {
    Policy policy;
public:
    void enhancedFunction() {
        // Before behavior
        policy.baseFunction();
        // After behavior
    }
};
```

##### Policy Hosts

Policy hosts aggregate multiple policies and provide a unified interface for the primary class. This approach helps in managing dependencies and interactions between policies.

```cpp
template <typename PolicyA, typename PolicyB>
class PolicyHost : public PolicyA, public PolicyB {
public:
    using PolicyA::methodA;
    using PolicyB::methodB;
};
```

The primary class then inherits from the policy host, gaining access to the combined functionality of all integrated policies.

```cpp
template <typename T, typename PolicyHost>
class HostClass : private PolicyHost {
public:
    void function() {
        PolicyHost::methodA();
        PolicyHost::methodB();
    }
};
```

#### Designing Effective Policy Combinations

Combining multiple policies effectively requires careful design consideration, ensuring that the interactions between policies are well-defined and do not introduce unexpected behaviors.

##### Interface Definition and Consistency

Each policy should define a clear and consistent interface. This ensures that multiple policies can be combined without conflicts or ambiguity. It helps to document the expected behavior of each method and the contract it adheres to.

##### Dependency Management

When combining policies, it is crucial to manage dependencies among them carefully. Policies should be designed to be as independent as possible, but when dependencies are unavoidable, they should be explicitly documented and managed.

1. **Explicit Dependencies**: Define dependencies clearly within the policy interfaces to ensure that combined policies interact predictably.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Where dependencies cannot be avoided, consider using dependency injection to decouple the policies as much as possible.

```cpp
template <typename T, typename Dependency>
class PolicyWithDependency {
    Dependency dep;
public:
    void function() {
        dep.depFunction();
    }
};
```

##### Conflict Resolution

When combining policies, conflicts might arise due to overlapping responsibilities or method names. These conflicts need to be resolved to ensure smooth integration:

1. **Renaming Methods**: Rename methods within policies to avoid collisions.
2. **Using `using` Declarations**: Use scoped `using` declarations to disambiguate method calls.

```cpp
template <typename PolicyA, typename PolicyB>
class CombinedPolicy : private PolicyA, private PolicyB {
public:
    using PolicyA::methodA;
    using PolicyB::methodB;

    void function() {
        methodA();
        methodB();
    }
};
```

##### Testing Combined Policies

Testing is crucial to ensure that combined policies work as intended. Each policy should be tested independently, and comprehensive integration tests should be conducted for the combined policies.

1. **Unit Testing of Individual Policies**: Ensure each policy behaves correctly in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing of Combined Policies**: Test the combined policies in various scenarios to verify their interactions and cumulative behavior.

##### Example: A Combined Policy for a Custom Container

Consider a custom container requiring:
- Memory allocation policy
- Error handling policy
- Thread-safety policy

Each policy can be designed independently and then combined to form a robust container class.

Memory Allocation Policy:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class StandardAllocPolicy {
public:
    static T* allocate(size_t n) {
        return static_cast<T*>(::operator new(n * sizeof(T)));
    }

    static void deallocate(T* p, size_t n) {
        ::operator delete(p);
    }
};
```

Error Handling Policy:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class StandardErrorPolicy {
public:
    void handleError(const std::string& err) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << err << std::endl;
    }
};
```

Thread-Safety Policy:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class ThreadSafePolicy {
public:
    mutable std::mutex mtx;

    void lock() const {
        mtx.lock();
    }

    void unlock() const {
        mtx.unlock();
    }
};
```

Combined Policy Host:
```cpp
template <typename T, typename AllocPolicy, typename ErrorPolicy, typename ThreadPolicy>
class PolicyHost : public AllocPolicy<T>, public ErrorPolicy<T>, public ThreadPolicy<T> {
public:
    using AllocPolicy<T>::allocate;
    using AllocPolicy<T>::deallocate;
    using ErrorPolicy<T>::handleError;
    using ThreadPolicy<T>::lock;
    using ThreadPolicy<T>::unlock;
};
```

Primary Container Class:
```cpp
template <typename T, template <typename> class AllocPolicy = StandardAllocPolicy,
                      template <typename> class ErrorPolicy = StandardErrorPolicy,
                      template <typename> class ThreadPolicy = ThreadSafePolicy>
class CustomContainer : private PolicyHost<T, AllocPolicy, ErrorPolicy, ThreadPolicy> {
public:
    void addElement(const T& element) {
        this->lock();
        try {
            // Insert element handling memory allocation and error handling
            // ...
        } catch (const std::exception& e) {
            this->handleError(e.what());
        }
        this->unlock();
    }
};
```

#### Summary

Combining policies in Policy-Based Design is a sophisticated technique that enhances modularity, customization, and reuse in C++ code. By employing various strategiesâ€”such as composition, layering, and hostsâ€”developers can integrate multiple policies to manage complex behaviors effectively. Careful attention must be paid to interface consistency, dependency management, and conflict resolution to ensure the combined policies work harmoniously. Through comprehensive testing, developers can guarantee the robustness and reliability of their combined policy designs. Mastering the art of combining policies thus equips developers with powerful tools for creating flexible, efficient, and maintainable software systems.

### Practical Examples

The theoretical concepts of policy-based design come to life when we see them applied in real-world scenarios. This chapter is dedicated to providing detailed, practical examples that illustrate the power and flexibility of Policy-Based Design in C++. The focus will be on enriching our understanding through real-life applications, ensuring that the techniques and best practices discussed previously are cemented through hands-on experience.

#### Example 1: Customizable Logging System

A logging system that can be tailored for different log levels, output formats, and destinations is a prime candidate for policy-based design. We'll explore how policy-based design can be used to create a flexible and maintainable logging system by defining and combining appropriate policies.

##### Step 1: Define Basic Policies

Define policies for log levels, formats, and destinations.

**Log Level Policy**:
```cpp
enum class LogLevel { INFO, WARNING, ERROR };

template <LogLevel L>
struct LogLevelPolicy {
    static constexpr LogLevel level = L;
};
```

**Log Format Policy**:
```cpp
template <typename T>
struct SimpleFormatPolicy {
    static std::string format(const std::string& message) {
        return "[LOG] " + message;
    }
};

template <typename T>
struct DetailedFormatPolicy {
    static std::string format(const std::string& message) {
        return "[DETAILED LOG]: " + message + " [END]";
    }
};
```

**Log Destination Policy**:
```cpp
template <typename T>
struct ConsoleDestinationPolicy {
    static void write(const std::string& message) {
        std::cout << message << std::endl;
    }
};

template <typename T>
struct FileDestinationPolicy {
    static void write(const std::string& message) {
        std::ofstream file("log.txt", std::ios::app);
        file << message << std::endl;
    }
};
```

##### Step 2: Combine Policies

Create a composite logger class that integrates these policies.

```cpp
template <
    typename T,
    template <LogLevel> class LevelPolicy,
    template <typename> class FormatPolicy,
    template <typename> class DestinationPolicy
>
class Logger : public LevelPolicy<T::level>, public FormatPolicy<T>, public DestinationPolicy<T> {
public:
    static void log(const std::string& message, LogLevel level) {
        if (level >= LevelPolicy<T::level>::level) {
            std::string formattedMessage = FormatPolicy<T>::format(message);
            DestinationPolicy<T>::write(formattedMessage);
        }
    }
};
```

##### Step 3: Usage

Define specific logger types by combining different policies.

```cpp
struct InfoLogger {};
using MyLogger = Logger<InfoLogger, LogLevelPolicy<LogLevel::INFO>, SimpleFormatPolicy, ConsoleDestinationPolicy>;

int main() {
    MyLogger::log("This is an info message.", LogLevel::INFO);
    MyLogger::log("This is a warning message.", LogLevel::WARNING);  // Will not be logged
}
```

By using policies, the logging system becomes highly customizable without changing the core `Logger` class. New policies for formats, levels, or destinations can be added and combined flexibly.

#### Example 2: Resource Management with Multiple Policies

Resource management often requires handling multiple aspects such as memory allocation, error handling, and concurrency. Let's explore a resource manager that integrates these policies to provide a robust solution.

##### Step 1: Define Policies

Define policies for memory allocation, error handling, and concurrency control.

**Memory Allocation Policy**:
```cpp
template <typename T>
struct StandardAllocPolicy {
    static T* allocate(size_t n) {
        return static_cast<T*>(::operator new(n * sizeof(T)));
    }

    static void deallocate(T* p, size_t n) {
        ::operator delete(p);
    }
};
```

**Error Handling Policy**:
```cpp
template <typename T>
struct StandardErrorPolicy {
    static void handleError(const std::string& err) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << err << std::endl;
    }
};
```

**Concurrency Control Policy**:
```cpp
template <typename T>
struct MutexConcurrencyPolicy {
    static std::mutex mutex;

    static void lock() {
        mutex.lock();
    }

    static void unlock() {
        mutex.unlock();
    }
};

template <typename T>
std::mutex MutexConcurrencyPolicy<T>::mutex;
```

##### Step 2: Combine Policies

Create a resource manager class that integrates these policies.

```cpp
template <
    typename T,
    template <typename> class AllocPolicy,
    template <typename> class ErrorPolicy,
    template <typename> class ConcurrencyPolicy
>
class ResourceManager : private AllocPolicy<T>, private ErrorPolicy<T>, private ConcurrencyPolicy<T> {
public:
    T* allocate(size_t n) {
        ConcurrencyPolicy<T>::lock();
        T* resource = nullptr;
        try {
            resource = AllocPolicy<T>::allocate(n);
        } catch (const std::exception& e) {
            ErrorPolicy<T>::handleError(e.what());
        }
        ConcurrencyPolicy<T>::unlock();
        return resource;
    }

    void deallocate(T* resource, size_t n) {
        ConcurrencyPolicy<T>::lock();
        AllocPolicy<T>::deallocate(resource, n);
        ConcurrencyPolicy<T>::unlock();
    }
};
```

##### Step 3: Usage

Define a specific resource manager type by combining the policies.

```cpp
using MyResourceManager = ResourceManager<int, StandardAllocPolicy, StandardErrorPolicy, MutexConcurrencyPolicy>;

int main() {
    MyResourceManager manager;

    int* resource = manager.allocate(10);
    manager.deallocate(resource, 10);
}
```

By doing this, the `ResourceManager` class is highly flexible and can be configured to use different allocation strategies, error handling mechanisms, and concurrency controls simply by defining new policies and combining them.

#### Example 3: Policy-Based Configuration System

Configuration systems often need to read various settings from multiple sources like environment variables, configuration files, or databases. Policy-based design can elegantly address this requirement by providing interchangeable policies for different configuration sources.

##### Step 1: Define Policies

Define policies for different configuration sources.

**Environment Variable Policy**:
```cpp
template <typename T>
struct EnvVarConfigPolicy {
    static std::string getValue(const std::string& key) {
        const char* value = std::getenv(key.c_str());
        if (value) return std::string(value);
        throw std::runtime_error("Environment variable not found");
    }
};
```

**File-Based Configuration Policy**:
```cpp
template <typename T>
struct FileConfigPolicy {
    static std::string getValue(const std::string& key) {
        std::ifstream file("config.txt");
        std::string line;
        while (std::getline(file, line)) {
            auto delimiterPos = line.find("=");
            auto name = line.substr(0, delimiterPos);
            if (name == key) {
                return line.substr(delimiterPos + 1);
            }
        }
        throw std::runtime_error("Configuration key not found in file");
    }
};
```

**Database Configuration Policy**:
```cpp
template <typename T>
struct DatabaseConfigPolicy {
    static std::string getValue(const std::string& key) {
        // Simulated database lookup
        if (key == "db_key") return "db_value";
        throw std::runtime_error("Configuration key not found in database");
    }
};
```

##### Step 2: Combine Policies

Create a configurable system class that integrates these policies.

```cpp
template <typename T,
          template <typename> class ConfigPolicy>
class ConfigurableSystem : private ConfigPolicy<T> {
public:
    std::string getConfigValue(const std::string& key) {
        return ConfigPolicy<T>::getValue(key);
    }
};
```

##### Step 3: Usage

Define specific configurable systems by combining the policies.

```cpp
using EnvVarSystem = ConfigurableSystem<int, EnvVarConfigPolicy>;
using FileSystem = ConfigurableSystem<int, FileConfigPolicy>;
using DatabaseSystem = ConfigurableSystem<int, DatabaseConfigPolicy>;

int main() {
    try {
        EnvVarSystem envSystem;
        std::cout << "EnvVar Config: " << envSystem.getConfigValue("ENV_VAR_KEY") << std::endl;
        
        FileSystem fileSystem;
        std::cout << "File Config: " << fileSystem.getConfigValue("file_key") << std::endl;
        
        DatabaseSystem dbSystem;
        std::cout << "Database Config: " << dbSystem.getConfigValue("db_key") << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
}
```

By utilizing policy-based design, the configuration system becomes highly versatile, allowing for easy addition of new configuration sources by defining new policies.

#### Best Practices for Practical Implementation

While implementing policy-based design in practical scenarios, some best practices ensure the design remains scalable, maintainable, and robust:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Ensure each policy handles a single aspect of the behavior. This fosters modularity and simplifies testing and maintenance.
2. **Clear Interfaces**: Define clear and minimal interfaces for policies to follow. This reduces the likelihood of conflicts and ensures easier integration.
3. **Extensive Testing**: Rigorously test each policy independently and in combination. Integration tests should cover all potential interaction scenarios.
4. **Documentation**: Adequately document each policy, describing its responsibilities, dependencies, and usage examples. Clear documentation aids in understanding and reusing policies.
5. **Default Policies**: Provide sensible default policies for components if specific customizations are not provided. This ensures ease of use while maintaining flexibility for advanced users.
6. **Dependency Management**: Explicitly manage dependencies between policies. Use dependency injection where possible to decouple policies and increase reusability.

#### Summary

Practical applications of Policy-Based Design in C++ demonstrate its versatility and power in creating flexible, maintainable, and reusable software components. By defining and combining policies for specific behaviors, complex systems can be built incrementally and transparently. The examples providedâ€”customizable logging systems, resource managers, and configuration systemsâ€”illustrate how policy-based design can be adeptly applied to solve real-world problems. Understanding and mastering these techniques will enable developers to create robust, adaptable software architectures aligned with modern software engineering paradigms.
