## 9. Conditional Type Traits

In Chapter 9, we delve into the fascinating world of conditional type traits in the C++ Standard Library. These powerful tools provide a way to customize types and enable or disable functions and class templates based on specific compile-time conditions. Central to this chapter are `std::conditional` and `std::enable_if`, which form the cornerstone of type-based logic in modern C++ programming. We will explore how `std::conditional` allows us to select between types based on a boolean condition, and how `std::enable_if` can be used to constrain template instantiation, ensuring that functions or classes are only enabled when certain conditions are met. Additionally, we will provide practical examples to illustrate these concepts in action, and delve into SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error), a paradigm that underpins the effectiveness of `std::enable_if`. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to harness these conditional type traits to write more robust, flexible, and maintainable C++ code.

### std::conditional

In this subchapter, we will undertake an in-depth examination of `std::conditional`, a critical template in the C++ Standard Library that allows for type selection based on compile-time boolean conditions. This type trait is essential for making decisions at compile-time, leading to more flexible and efficient code. We will start with the fundamental concepts, explain the syntax and mechanics of `std::conditional`, and then explore its applications and limitations. Our journey will be thorough, covering theoretical aspects as well as practical considerations.

#### Introduction to Conditional Type Traits

Conditional type traits provide a powerful mechanism to select between different types based on a boolean constant known at compile-time. The key aspect of these traits is their ability to customize type behavior without running any runtime code, thus they contribute to zero-cost abstraction—a foundational principle in modern C++.

`std::conditional`, introduced in C++11, is a template that evaluates a condition (a compile-time constant expression) and yields one of two types depending on the outcome of the evaluation.

#### Syntax and Mechanism

The `std::conditional` template is defined in the `<type_traits>` header file and has the following general form:

```cpp
template <bool B, class T, class F>
struct conditional {
    typedef T type;
};

template <class T, class F>
struct conditional<false, T, F> {
    typedef F type;
};
```

The template parameters are:

1. `B`: A boolean compile-time constant (`true` or `false`).
2. `T`: The type to select if `B` is `true`.
3. `F`: The type to select if `B` is `false`.

When `B` is `true`, `std::conditional<B, T, F>::type` is defined as `T`. Conversely, if `B` is `false`, `std::conditional<B, T, F>::type` is defined as `F`.

Here is an illustrative example:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

template <bool B, class T, class F>
using conditional_t = typename std::conditional<B, T, F>::type;

int main() {
    using TypeTrue = conditional_t<true, int, double>;  // TypeTrue is `int`
    using TypeFalse = conditional_t<false, int, double>; // TypeFalse is `double`
}
```

In the above example, when `B` is `true`, `conditional_t` is defined as `int`, and when `B` is `false`, it is defined as `double`.

#### Metaprogramming with `std::conditional`

To appreciate the utility of `std::conditional`, consider its role within the context of template metaprogramming. Metaprogramming allows for creating programs that can reason about and manipulate types, thus enabling the development of highly generic and reusable components. `std::conditional` is an indispensable part of this toolkit. 

##### Trait Customization

Suppose you are designing a template class that should behave differently depending on whether a particular type is integral or a floating-point type. By leveraging `std::conditional` in conjunction with other type traits such as `std::is_integral` and `std::is_floating_point`, you can create customized traits.

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

template <typename T>
struct NumericTraits {
    using LargerType = typename std::conditional<
        std::is_integral<T>::value,
        long long,
        double
    >::type;
};

// Usage of NumericTraits
int main() {
    using IntLargerType = NumericTraits<int>::LargerType;  // IntLargerType is `long long`
    using DoubleLargerType = NumericTraits<double>::LargerType;  // DoubleLargerType is `double`
}
```

In this example, `NumericTraits` defines a type alias `LargerType` that resolves to a larger type based on whether `T` is an integral type or a floating-point type.

##### Policy-Based Design

Policy-based design is a design paradigm in which a class's behavior is customized via template parameters that define specific policies. `std::conditional` is instrumental in this design, allowing policies to be composed in flexible ways.

```cpp
enum class Policy { Integral, Floating };

template <Policy P>
struct PolicyType {
    using Type = typename std::conditional<P == Policy::Integral, int, double>::type;
};

// Usage of PolicyType
int main() {
    using IntegralPolicyType = PolicyType<Policy::Integral>::Type;  // IntegralPolicyType is `int`
    using FloatingPolicyType = PolicyType<Policy::Floating>::Type;  // FloatingPolicyType is `double`
}
```

In this example, `PolicyType` chooses between `int` and `double` based on a `Policy` enum value.

#### Practical Applications

##### Optimized Storage

Consider an application where you need to store numeric data and optimize storage space based on type. For example, you might want to choose between `std::vector` and `std::array` for performance reasons depending on whether you're storing floating-point or integral types.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <array>

template <typename T>
struct Storage {
    using Type = typename std::conditional<
        std::is_floating_point<T>::value,
        std::vector<T>,
        std::array<T, 100>
    >::type;
};

// Usage of Storage
int main() {
    using FloatStorage = Storage<float>::Type;  // FloatStorage is `std::vector<float>`
    using IntStorage = Storage<int>::Type;  // IntStorage is `std::array<int, 100>
}
```

Here, `Storage` chooses between `std::vector` and `std::array` based on whether `T` is a floating-point type.

##### Interface Adaptation

Another application of `std::conditional` is in adapting interfaces conditionally. Suppose you are interfacing with hardware or a library that requires different types or classes, depending on the platform or compilation settings.

```cpp
template <bool IsEmbedded>
struct PlatformTraits {
    using TimerType = typename std::conditional<IsEmbedded, EmbeddedTimer, DesktopTimer>::type;
};

// Usage of PlatformTraits
int main() {
    using EmbeddedPlatformTimer = PlatformTraits<true>::TimerType;  // EmbeddedPlatformTimer is `EmbeddedTimer`
    using DesktopPlatformTimer = PlatformTraits<false>::TimerType;  // DesktopPlatformTimer is `DesktopTimer`
}
```

In this scenario, `PlatformTraits` chooses between `EmbeddedTimer` and `DesktopTimer` based on the compile-time boolean flag `IsEmbedded`.

#### Performance Considerations

`std::conditional` contributes to compile-time computation, which means it plays no role in runtime performance. However, the types selected via `std::conditional` can significantly impact the efficiency, memory footprint, and overall performance characteristics of the application. For example, choosing between a dynamically allocated vector and a statically allocated array could lead to vastly different performance profiles.

Due consideration must be given to ensure that the conditions evaluated by `std::conditional` are efficient. Overuse of complex meta-programming constructs might lead to longer compilation times, so a balanced approach is necessary.

#### Limitations and Considerations

While `std::conditional` is a versatile tool, it does have limitations:

1. **Readability**: Overuse of deep meta-programming and conditional type selection can make code harder to read and maintain.
2. **Complexity**: Compounded or nested use of `std::conditional` can rapidly increase code complexity, making debugging and static analysis more challenging.
3. **Diagnostic Messages**: Template meta-programming error messages can sometimes be cryptic and hard to decipher. Good documentation and thoughtful design can mitigate this issue.

#### Conclusion

In summary, `std::conditional` is a cornerstone of conditional type traits in the C++ Standard Library. Its ability to select between types based on compile-time conditions unlocks powerful metaprogramming capabilities and supports various design paradigms, including policy-based design and trait customization. Whether optimizing storage, interfacing conditionally with different platforms, or implementing complex template logic, `std::conditional` proves indispensable. Understanding and leveraging this type trait effectively can lead to clean, efficient, and highly flexible C++ code.

### std::enable_if

In this subchapter, we will embark on a comprehensive exploration of `std::enable_if`, one of the most powerful and flexible tools available in the C++ Standard Library for template metaprogramming. Introduced in C++11, `std::enable_if` is a SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) utility that allows developers to conditionally enable or disable function and class template instantiations based on compile-time boolean conditions. This level of control facilitates writing highly generic and robust C++ code. We will delve into its syntax, mechanics, applications, limitations, and best practices, providing a rigorous examination of `std::enable_if` in both theoretical and practical contexts.

#### Introduction to SFINAE and `std::enable_if`

SFINAE stands for "Substitution Failure Is Not An Error," a principle in C++ template metaprogramming which allows the compiler to discard template instantiations that fail to meet certain conditions without generating a compilation error. `std::enable_if` leverages this principle by enabling you to guard function and class templates against inappropriate or unintended types.

The core idea behind `std::enable_if` is to use type traits and boolean conditions to determine whether a certain function or class template specialization should exist. This allows you to write code that is both safer and more expressive, tailoring the behavior of generic components precisely to the types they operate on.

#### Syntax and Mechanics

`std::enable_if` is defined in the `<type_traits>` header file and has the following general form:

```cpp
template <bool B, class T = void>
struct enable_if {};

template <class T>
struct enable_if<true, T> {
    typedef T type;
};
```

The template parameters are:

1. `B`: A boolean compile-time constant (`true` or `false`).
2. `T`: The resultant type if `B` is `true`. By default, this is `void`.

When `B` is `true`, `std::enable_if<B, T>::type` is defined as `T`. If `B` is `false`, there is no member `type`, and an attempt to use `std::enable_if<B, T>` will result in a substitution failure, effectively disabling the surrounding template.

For convenience, C++14 introduced `std::enable_if_t`, which simplifies the syntax by negating the need to specify `typename` and `::type` every time:

```cpp
template <bool B, class T = void>
using enable_if_t = typename std::enable_if<B, T>::type;
```

#### Function Template Specialization using `std::enable_if`

One of the common applications of `std::enable_if` is to constrain function templates. This ensures that a function template is only instantiated and callable when certain conditions are met.

##### Overload Resolution

A classic use case is to enable a function template for a subset of types, such as integral types or floating-point types. Here’s an example demonstrating how to use `std::enable_if` to constrain a function to only accept integral types:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>
#include <iostream>

// Function enabled only for integral types
template <typename T>
std::enable_if_t<std::is_integral<T>::value, void>
process(T value) {
    std::cout << "Processing integral type: " << value << std::endl;
}

// Function enabled only for floating-point types
template <typename T>
std::enable_if_t<std::is_floating_point<T>::value, void>
process(T value) {
    std::cout << "Processing floating-point type: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    process(10);     // Integral overload
    process(10.5);   // Floating-point overload
    // process("Hello"); // Compilation error: no matching function to call
}
```

In this example, two overloads of the `process` function are defined, each constrained to a specific category of types using `std::enable_if`.

##### Return Type SFINAE

`std::enable_if` can also be used to conditionally define a function's return type, leading to more complex and flexible function templates. The typical syntax for this use case is:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename std::enable_if<std::is_integral<T>::value, int>::type = 0>
T increment(T value) {
    return value + 1;
}
```

In this example, `increment` is only enabled if `T` is an integral type, otherwise, the function template is not generated, thus preventing inadvertent usage with incompatible types.

#### Class Template Specialization using `std::enable_if`

In addition to function templates, `std::enable_if` finds great utility in class templates, allowing the conditional definition of class members and specializations.

##### Partial Specialization

Consider a scenario where you want to define different behaviors for a class template depending on whether the type is integral or floating-point. Here’s how you can achieve this using `std::enable_if`:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>
#include <iostream>

template <typename T, typename Enable = void>
class Numeric;

template <typename T>
class Numeric<T, std::enable_if_t<std::is_integral<T>::value>> {
public:
    void info() {
        std::cout << "Integral type" << std::endl;
    }
};

template <typename T>
class Numeric<T, std::enable_if_t<std::is_floating_point<T>::value>> {
public:
    void info() {
        std::cout << "Floating-point type" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Numeric<int> intNumeric;
    intNumeric.info();  // Outputs: Integral type

    Numeric<double> floatNumeric;
    floatNumeric.info();  // Outputs: Floating-point type
}
```

In this example, the `Numeric` class template has two partial specializations: one for integral types and one for floating-point types. Depending on the template parameter `T`, the appropriate specialization is selected during compilation.

#### Practical Applications of `std::enable_if`

`std::enable_if` is a versatile tool with numerous applications in real-world C++ programming. Here are some common scenarios:

- **Type-Safe Function Overloading**: As demonstrated earlier, `std::enable_if` can ensure that function templates are only instantiated for appropriate types, preventing unintended usage and potential runtime errors.
- **Traits-Based Design**: You can use `std::enable_if` in combination with type traits to implement traits-based designs, providing tailored behavior for different categories of types.
- **Generic Algorithms**: In generic algorithm implementations, `std::enable_if` can be used to optimize functions for specific type characteristics. For instance, algorithms can be specialized and optimized for types that support certain operations or properties.
- **Compile-Time Assertions**: `std::enable_if` can be employed to enforce compile-time assertions, ensuring that certain conditions are met before instantiating templates. This leads to better error-checking and more robust code.

##### Example: Type-Safe Container

Consider a custom container that only accepts types satisfying specific conditions, such as being default-constructible and copy-assignable:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>
#include <vector>

template <typename T, 
          typename = std::enable_if_t<std::is_default_constructible<T>::value>,
          typename = std::enable_if_t<std::is_copy_assignable<T>::value>>
class SafeContainer {
public:
    void add(const T& value) {
        data_.push_back(value);
    }
    // Other container methods...
private:
    std::vector<T> data_;
};

int main() {
    SafeContainer<int> intContainer;  // Valid, int is default-constructible and copy-assignable
    intContainer.add(1);

    // SafeContainer<void> voidContainer; // Compilation error: void is not default-constructible or copy-assignable
}
```

In this example, `SafeContainer` uses `std::enable_if` to ensure that it is only instantiated for types that are default-constructible and copy-assignable.

#### Performance Considerations

While `std::enable_if` itself does not directly impact runtime performance, the types and structures it selects or enables can have significant performance implications. For instance, using `std::enable_if` to choose between different algorithm implementations based on type characteristics can lead to optimized code paths and better overall performance.

However, the compile-time complexity introduced by extensive use of `std::enable_if` and deep meta-programming can affect compilation times and error message clarity. Therefore, it is crucial to balance the use of `std::enable_if` with other design considerations to maintain code readability and manage compilation costs.

#### Limitations and Caveats

Despite its powerful capabilities, `std::enable_if` has some limitations and considerations that developers should be aware of:

1. **Error Message Clarity**: One of the primary challenges with `std::enable_if` is that substitution failures can lead to unclear or complex error messages, making debugging more difficult.
2. **Code Readability**: Overuse of `std::enable_if` can obscure the intentions of the code, reducing readability and making maintenance harder. Clear documentation and coding standards can mitigate this issue.
3. **Template Instantiation Limits**: Extensive meta-programming and use of `std::enable_if` can push the compiler's template instantiation limits, especially in large codebases or complex libraries.
4. **SFINAE Alternatives**: C++20 introduced concepts, an alternative and more expressive mechanism for constraining templates. While `std::enable_if` remains valuable, concepts provide a more modern approach to achieving similar goals with improved readability and error diagnostics.

#### Conclusion

In summary, `std::enable_if` is a cornerstone of modern C++ template metaprogramming, offering developers the ability to conditionally enable or disable function and class template instantiations based on compile-time conditions. By leveraging SFINAE, `std::enable_if` ensures type safety, enables type-specific optimizations, and supports sophisticated template logic. Whether used for function overloading, class template specialization, or enforcing compile-time assertions, `std::enable_if` enhances the flexibility and robustness of C++ codebases. Understanding its mechanics, applications, and limitations is crucial for any C++ developer looking to harness the full power of template metaprogramming.

### Practical Examples and SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)

In this subchapter, we delve into the practical applications of SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) and explore how it can be leveraged to write more robust and flexible C++ code. SFINAE is a powerful principle in template metaprogramming that allows the compiler to discard certain template instantiations that don't meet specific criteria, without causing a compilation error. We will provide a thorough examination of various practical examples where SFINAE proves invaluable, including type traits, function overloading, class templates, and more. By the end of this subchapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to apply SFINAE principles to solve complex programming challenges elegantly and efficiently.

#### Introduction to SFINAE

SFINAE, short for "Substitution Failure Is Not An Error," is a core concept in C++ template programming. It allows the compiler to ignore certain template instantiations if the substitution of template arguments fails, without producing a compilation error. Essentially, the compiler continues to search for other viable instantiations that meet the template requirements.

This mechanism provides a way to impose constraints and specialize templates in a highly flexible manner, enabling advanced compile-time polymorphism. SFINAE forms the foundation for many modern C++ techniques, including type traits, metaprogramming, and conditional compilation.

#### SFINAE and Type Traits

Type traits are a collection of templates that provide information about types at compile-time. They are fundamental to many template metaprogramming techniques, and SFINAE is often used in conjunction with type traits to enable or disable template specializations based on type properties.

**Example: Detecting Integral Types**

Suppose you want to create a function template that operates only on integral types. You can use `std::enable_if` combined with `std::is_integral` (a type trait) to achieve this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

template <typename T>
typename std::enable_if<std::is_integral<T>::value, T>::type
increment(T value) {
    return value + 1;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << increment(1) << std::endl;  // Works
    // std::cout << increment(1.5) << std::endl;  // Compilation error: std::enable_if conditions not met
}
```

In this example, the `increment` function template is enabled only for integral types such as `int` and `char`. The SFINAE mechanism ensures that the function won't compile for non-integral types like `double`.

#### Function Overloading with SFINAE

Function overloading is a powerful feature in C++, and SFINAE can be employed to control which function overloads are available based on template arguments. This enables more granular control over which functions can be instantiated and called.

**Example: Overloading for Integral and Floating-Point Types**

Consider a set of overloaded functions that should behave differently for integral and floating-point types:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

// Function enabled only for integral types
template <typename T>
typename std::enable_if<std::is_integral<T>::value, void>::type
process(T value) {
    std::cout << "Processing integral type: " << value << std::endl;
}

// Function enabled only for floating-point types
template <typename T>
typename std::enable_if<std::is_floating_point<T>::value, void>::type
process(T value) {
    std::cout << "Processing floating-point type: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    process(10);       // Integral overload
    process(10.5);     // Floating-point overload
    // process("Hello"); // Compilation error: no suitable function to call
}
```

In this scenario, two function overloads are defined, each guarded by `std::enable_if` and a type trait (`std::is_integral` or `std::is_floating_point`). The appropriate function is selected based on the type of the argument at compile-time, ensuring type-safe operations.

#### Class Templates with SFINAE

SFINAE can be applied to class templates as well, enabling conditional class template specialization or member function instantiation based on compile-time conditions.

**Example: Conditional Member Functions**

You might have a class template that should only provide certain member functions if the template parameter meets specific criteria.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

template <typename T>
class MyClass {
public:
    // Member function enabled only for integral types
    template <typename U = T>
    typename std::enable_if<std::is_integral<U>::value, void>::type
    foo() {
        std::cout << "Foo for integral type" << std::endl;
    }

    // Member function enabled only for floating-point types
    template <typename U = T>
    typename std::enable_if<std::is_floating_point<U>::value, void>::type
    foo() {
        std::cout << "Foo for floating-point type" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass<int> integralObject;
    integralObject.foo();  // Outputs: Foo for integral type

    MyClass<double> floatingObject;
    floatingObject.foo();  // Outputs: Foo for floating-point type
}
```

In this example, the `MyClass` template provides different `foo` member functions depending on whether `T` is an integral or floating-point type. SFINAE ensures that only the appropriate member function is instantiated, maintaining type safety and correct behavior.

#### Advanced SFINAE Techniques

SFINAE can be used in more advanced scenarios to implement sophisticated template metaprogramming logic. Below are some examples that demonstrate its advanced applications.

**Example: Detecting Member Functions**

Suppose you want a template to check if a class has a specific member function and conditionally enable functionality based on that:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

// Primary template: assumes the class does not have the desired method
template <typename, typename T>
struct has_foo {
    static_assert(
        std::integral_constant<T, false>::value,
        "Second template parameter needs to be of function type."
    );
};

// Specialization that does the check
template <typename C, typename Ret, typename... Args>
struct has_foo<C, Ret(Args...)> {
private:
    template <typename T>
    static constexpr auto check(T*) 
        -> typename std::is_same<
            decltype(std::declval<T>().foo(std::declval<Args>()...)),
            Ret    // Verify if the return type matches
        >::type;
    
    template <typename>
    static constexpr std::false_type check(...);

    typedef decltype(check<C>(0)) type;

public:
    static constexpr bool value = type::value;  // True if C has the method with given signature
};

// Usage in a class template
template <typename T>
class MyClass {
public:
    void callFoo() {
        callFooImpl<T>();
    }

private:
    template <typename U>
    typename std::enable_if<has_foo<U, void()>::value>::type
    callFooImpl() {
        U().foo();  // Call foo if it exists
    }

    template <typename U>
    typename std::enable_if<!has_foo<U, void()>::value>::type
    callFooImpl() {
        std::cout << "No foo method available" << std::endl;
    }
};

class WithFoo {
public:
    void foo() {
        std::cout << "WithFoo::foo called" << std::endl;
    }
};

class WithoutFoo {};

int main() {
    MyClass<WithFoo> withFoo;
    withFoo.callFoo();  // Outputs: WithFoo::foo called

    MyClass<WithoutFoo> withoutFoo;
    withoutFoo.callFoo();  // Outputs: No foo method available
}
```

In this example, the `has_foo` template checks if a class `C` has a member function `foo` with a specified signature. The `MyClass` template then conditionally defines a `callFooImpl` method based on whether `T` has the `foo` method. This approach demonstrates the power of SFINAE for introspecting types and adapting behavior accordingly.

#### Performance Considerations

SFINAE primarily influences compile-time behavior and has minimal direct impact on runtime performance. However, the compile-time checks and the complexity of template metaprogramming might affect the compilation time and generate complex error messages.

- **Compilation Time**: Extensive SFINAE use can increase compilation times, especially in large projects with many template instantiations. It's essential to balance SFINAE's benefits with the potential compilation overhead.
- **Error Diagnostics**: Errors related to SFINAE often result in verbose and cryptic compiler error messages, making debugging challenging. Modern C++ compilers have improved error diagnostics, but understanding the generated messages may still require significant effort.

#### Limitations and Best Practices

While SFINAE is a powerful technique, there are limitations and best practices that developers should keep in mind:

1. **Readability**: Overusing SFINAE can make code harder to read and understand. Clear documentation and naming conventions help mitigate this issue.
2. **Error Messages**: As noted, SFINAE-related error messages can be difficult to decipher. Testing templates with simpler cases first and incrementally building complexity can aid in debugging.
3. **Concepts**: C++20 introduces concepts, a new feature that provides a more expressive and readable way to constrain templates. Concepts can be seen as an evolution of SFINAE, offering improved clarity and better compiler diagnostics.

**Example: Concepts as Alternative to SFINAE**

Consider rewriting the previous example using C++20 concepts:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <concepts>

template <typename T>
concept HasFoo = requires(T t) {
    { t.foo() } -> std::same_as<void>;
};

template <HasFoo T>
void callFoo() {
    T().foo();
}

template <typename T>
requires (!HasFoo<T>)
void callFoo() {
    std::cout << "No foo method available" << std::endl;
}

class WithFoo {
public:
    void foo() {
        std::cout << "WithFoo::foo called" << std::endl;
    }
};

class WithoutFoo {};

int main() {
    callFoo<WithFoo>();      // Outputs: WithFoo::foo called
    callFoo<WithoutFoo>();   // Outputs: No foo method available

In this example, the `HasFoo` concept simplifies checking for the presence of a `foo` member function. The `callFoo` function template is more readable and straightforward compared to the SFINAE version.

### Conclusion

SFINAE is a fundamental and powerful principle in C++ that enables conditional template instantiation based on compile-time conditions. It plays a crucial role in type traits, function overloading, class template specialization, and more. By mastering SFINAE, developers can write more flexible, type-safe, and expressive C++ code.

This subchapter has provided a detailed exploration of SFINAE, covering its mechanics, practical applications, advanced techniques, performance considerations, and limitations. With this knowledge, you can leverage SFINAE effectively in your C++ projects, while also considering modern alternatives like C++20 concepts to further enhance code clarity and maintainability.
