## 13. Policy Selection

In Chapter 13, we delve into the crucial aspects of Policy Selection within the domain of Policy-Based Design. This chapter explores both static and dynamic methods of policy determination, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to select and employ policies effectively in C++ programs. By mastering static policy selection, developers can leverage compile-time mechanisms for improved efficiency and type safety. Conversely, dynamic policy selection offers flexibility and runtime adaptability, catering to scenarios where compile-time decisions are insufficient. To concretize these concepts, we will also present practical examples that highlight real-world applications and illustrate the seamless integration of policy-based architectures in your software design. As we navigate through these topics, you will gain the expertise to harness the full potential of policies, ensuring that your C++ projects are both robust and adaptable.

### Static Policy Selection

#### Introduction to Static Policy Selection

Static Policy Selection in C++ is a technique whereby the policy to be employed by a class or function is determined at compile-time. This allows for optimal performance, as the decision-making overhead is resolved during compilation, leading to extremely efficient and highly optimized code. Leveraging static policies also enhances type safety, ensuring that the correct policies are applied strictly based on the types known at compile time.

In this chapter, we will explore the mechanisms and implementations of static policy selection in C++. We will discuss the advantages of static policies, the integration of templates, the role of metaprogramming, and how static policies contribute to the overall design and optimization of complex systems. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a thorough understanding of how to implement, utilize, and benefit from static policy selection in C++.

#### The Role of Templates in Static Policy Selection

Templates are the cornerstone of static policy selection in C++. They provide a mechanism to create generic and reusable code components that can operate with any data type. This is particularly important for policy-based design, as it allows the developer to specify policies as template parameters, which are then instantiated at compile time.

Consider the following example:

```cpp
template<typename Policy>
class Algorithm {
public:
    void execute() {
        Policy::apply();
    }
};
```

In this example, the `Algorithm` class is parameterized with a `Policy` type. The `execute` function calls a static method `apply` on the `Policy` type. By passing different policies as template arguments, the behavior of the `Algorithm` class can be modified without altering its implementation.

#### Advantages of Static Policy Selection

1. **Performance**: Static policy selection occurs at compile time, eliminating any runtime overhead associated with policy decisions. This results in faster and more efficient code execution.
2. **Type Safety**: Since policies are chosen at compile time, the compiler can enforce type correctness, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
3. **Code Clarity and Maintenance**: Policies can be designed, tested, and maintained independently, leading to cleaner and more modular code architectures.
4. **Optimization Potential**: The compiler is able to perform more aggressive optimizations when policy decisions are known at compile time.

#### Implementing Static Policies with Traits

The use of traits classes is a common technique in static policy selection. Traits classes provide a way to associate certain types or values with a given type, which can then be used to customize the behavior of generic components.

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct PolicyTraits {
    static void apply() {
        // Default implementation
    }
};

// Specialization for specific type
template<>
struct PolicyTraits<int> {
    static void apply() {
        // Implementation for int
    }
};
```

In this example, `PolicyTraits` is a traits class with a static method `apply`. The `PolicyTraits` template is specialized for the `int` type, providing a customized implementation of the `apply` method.

#### Policy Classes and Static Members

Policy classes often use static members to define behavior that can be substituted at compile-time. For example:

```cpp
class PolicyA {
public:
    static void apply() {
        std::cout << "Applying Policy A" << std::endl;
    }
};

class PolicyB {
public:
    static void apply() {
        std::cout << "Applying Policy B" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

These policy classes can then be used in a templated context:

```cpp
template<typename Policy>
class Context {
public:
    void performAction() {
        Policy::apply();
    }
};

int main() {
    Context<PolicyA> contextA;
    contextA.performAction(); // Output: Applying Policy A
    
    Context<PolicyB> contextB;
    contextB.performAction(); // Output: Applying Policy B
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this scenario, the `Context` class is parameterized with a policy class, and the `performAction` method invokes the `apply` method of the policy class. The specific behavior is determined at compile-time based on which policy is passed to the `Context` template.

#### Combining Policies Using Template Specialization

Template specialization can be employed to combine different policies conditionally. This technique allows for the creation of highly customizable and flexible designs.

```cpp
template<typename Policy1, typename Policy2>
class CombinedAlgorithm {
public:
    void execute() {
        Policy1::apply();
        Policy2::apply();
    }
};

// Specialization for specific policy combination
template<>
class CombinedAlgorithm<PolicyA, PolicyB> {
public:
    void execute() {
        std::cout << "Special combined behavior for PolicyA and PolicyB" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

In this example, `CombinedAlgorithm` is a template class parameterized with two policies. A specialized version of the class is provided for the combination of `PolicyA` and `PolicyB`, which defines a custom behavior for this specific policy combination.

#### Static Policy Selection and CRTP

The Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) is another powerful technique in C++ metaprogramming that can be combined with static policy selection. It involves a class inheriting from a template instantiation of itself, allowing for static polymorphism.

```cpp
template<typename Derived>
class BasePolicy {
public:
    void apply() {
        static_cast<Derived*>(this)->doApply();
    }
};

class DerivedPolicy : public BasePolicy<DerivedPolicy> {
public:
    void doApply() {
        std::cout << "Applying Derived Policy" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    DerivedPolicy policy;
    policy.apply(); // Output: Applying Derived Policy
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `BasePolicy` class template defines a method `apply` that calls `doApply` on the derived class using a static cast. The `DerivedPolicy` class inherits from `BasePolicy` and implements the `doApply` method.

#### Compiling Policies Using SFINAE

Substitution Failure Is Not An Error (SFINAE) is a principle in C++ templates allowing for the graceful handling of policy selection. SFINAE can be used to enable or disable methods based on the presence of certain member types or functions within the policy.

```cpp
template<typename Policy, typename = void>
class Algorithm {
public:
    void execute() {
        std::cout << "Default Policy" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Specialization enabling policy with apply() method
template<typename Policy>
class Algorithm<Policy, std::void_t<decltype(std::declval<Policy>().apply())>> {
public:
    void execute() {
        Policy().apply();
    }
};
```

Here, the `Algorithm` class template has a default implementation of the `execute` method. Another specialization using SFINAE enables a version of the class when the provided policy has an `apply` method.

#### Compile-Time Policy Selection with if constexpr

The `if constexpr` statement in C++17 and later versions allows for conditional compilation paths within a single function, enabling static policy selection within functions.

```cpp
template<typename Policy>
void execute() {
    if constexpr (std::is_same_v<Policy, PolicyA>) {
        PolicyA::apply();
    } else if constexpr (std::is_same_v<Policy, PolicyB>) {
        PolicyB::apply();
    } else {
        std::cout << "Unknown Policy" << std::endl;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `execute` function conditionally compiles different code paths based on the type of `Policy` using `if constexpr`. This allows for static policy selection within a single function body, providing an elegant solution for compile-time decisions.

#### Static Assertions and Policy Verification

Static assertions (static_assert) are a powerful tool to enforce constraints and verify assumptions at compile-time. They can be used to ensure that only valid policies are selected.

```cpp
template<typename Policy>
class Validator {
public:
    Validator() {
        static_assert(std::is_base_of<BasePolicy, Policy>::value, "Policy must be derived from BasePolicy");
    }
};
```

In this example, the `Validator` class template checks that the `Policy` parameter is derived from `BasePolicy`. If this constraint is violated, a compile-time error is generated.

#### Summary

Static policy selection in C++ offers a myriad of benefits, including enhanced performance, type safety, and code clarity. By utilizing templates, traits, CRTP, SFINAE, `if constexpr`, and static assertions, developers can create highly efficient and flexible designs. Understanding the principles and techniques of static policy selection equips developers with the knowledge to write robust and optimized C++ code that leverages the full power of compile-time decisions.

### Dynamic Policy Selection

#### Introduction to Dynamic Policy Selection

Dynamic policy selection is a technique in C++ where the appropriate policy is chosen at runtime based on certain conditions or inputs. Unlike static policy selection that occurs at compile-time, dynamic policy selection provides a higher degree of flexibility, allowing programs to adapt to changing conditions or configurations while they execute. This flexibility, however, comes at the cost of potential runtime overhead, type safety concerns, and possible performance penalties when compared to static policy selection.

In this chapter, we will explore the mechanisms of dynamic policy selection, the use of polymorphism and interfaces, dynamic dispatch, and how to balance the trade-offs between flexibility and performance. We will discuss scenarios where dynamic policy selection is appropriate and how it can complement static policies in building robust and adaptive C++ applications.

#### The Role of Polymorphism in Dynamic Policy Selection

Polymorphism, particularly runtime polymorphism via inheritance and virtual functions, is central to dynamic policy selection. By defining a common interface that multiple policies adhere to, C++ allows objects to be treated polymorphically, with the appropriate policy behavior being determined at runtime.

Consider the following example:

```cpp
class Policy {
public:
    virtual ~Policy() = default;
    virtual void apply() = 0;
};

class PolicyA : public Policy {
public:
    void apply() override {
        std::cout << "Applying Policy A" << std::endl;
    }
};

class PolicyB : public Policy {
public:
    void apply() override {
        std::cout << "Applying Policy B" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

Here, `Policy` is an abstract base class with a pure virtual function `apply`. `PolicyA` and `PolicyB` are concrete implementations of this interface. We can use these classes polymorphically:

```cpp
void executePolicy(Policy* policy) {
    policy->apply();
}

int main() {
    PolicyA a;
    PolicyB b;

    executePolicy(&a); // Output: Applying Policy A
    executePolicy(&b); // Output: Applying Policy B

    return 0;
}
```

The `executePolicy` function accepts a pointer to `Policy` and invokes the `apply` method. The actual behavior is determined dynamically based on the concrete policy object passed to the function.

#### Dynamic Dispatch and Virtual Function Overheads

Dynamic dispatch is the process whereby the correct function implementation is chosen at runtime using a mechanism known as the virtual table (vtable). While this provides significant flexibility, it incurs a runtime cost due to the indirection involved in looking up the function address in the vtable.

The overhead associated with dynamic dispatch includes:
1. **Memory Overhead**: Each polymorphic class needs to store a vtable pointer, increasing memory usage.
2. **Performance Overhead**: Function calls to virtual methods involve an additional indirection and a potential cache miss, which can affect performance.
3. **Inlined Code**: Virtual functions cannot be inlined by the compiler, resulting in potential performance degradation compared to non-virtual function calls.

Despite these overheads, dynamic dispatch is invaluable in scenarios where runtime flexibility is essential.

#### Role of Factory Patterns in Policy Selection

Factory patterns are often employed to create objects based on runtime conditions. These patterns abstract the instantiation logic and encapsulate the decision-making process, making dynamic policy selection more streamlined.

```cpp
class PolicyFactory {
public:
    static std::unique_ptr<Policy> createPolicy(const std::string& type) {
        if (type == "A") {
            return std::make_unique<PolicyA>();
        } else if (type == "B") {
            return std::make_unique<PolicyB>();
        } else {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Unknown policy type");
        }
    }
};
```

In this example, the `PolicyFactory` class has a static method `createPolicy` that takes a `std::string` describing the type of policy to create. This method returns a `std::unique_ptr` to the appropriate `Policy` object.

#### Dynamic Policy Selection with Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is another design pattern conducive to dynamic policy selection. It involves defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable within a context.

```cpp
class Context {
private:
    std::unique_ptr<Policy> policy_;
public:
    void setPolicy(std::unique_ptr<Policy> policy) {
        policy_ = std::move(policy);
    }

    void execute() {
        policy_->apply();
    }
};

int main() {
    Context context;
    context.setPolicy(std::make_unique<PolicyA>());
    context.execute(); // Output: Applying Policy A

    context.setPolicy(std::make_unique<PolicyB>());
    context.execute(); // Output: Applying Policy B

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Context` class maintains a `unique_ptr` to a `Policy`. The `setPolicy` method allows the policy to be changed at runtime, and the `execute` method applies the current policy.

#### Use of Type Erasure for Dynamic Policies

Type erasure is a technique to achieve runtime polymorphism without inheritance by hiding the specific type behind a uniform interface. This is particularly useful when the types of policies are not known at compile time but need to be used in a type-safe manner.

```cpp
class AnyPolicy {
    struct PolicyConcept {
        virtual ~PolicyConcept() = default;
        virtual void apply() const = 0;
    };

    template<typename T>
    struct PolicyModel : PolicyConcept {
        T policyInstance;

        PolicyModel(T policy) : policyInstance(policy) {}
        void apply() const override {
            policyInstance.apply();
        }
    };

    std::unique_ptr<PolicyConcept> policy_;
    
public:
    template<typename T>
    AnyPolicy(T policy) : policy_(std::make_unique<PolicyModel<T>>(policy)) {}

    void apply() const {
        policy_->apply();
    }
};
```

In this example, the `AnyPolicy` class uses type erasure to store any policy and apply it at runtime. The specific type of policy is hidden behind a `PolicyConcept` interface, allowing for uniform usage.

#### Combining Static and Dynamic Policies

In many real-world scenarios, a hybrid approach combining static and dynamic policy selection is most effective. Static policies can enforce compile-time constraints and optimizations, while dynamic policies provide the necessary runtime flexibility.

Consider a scenario where a class uses static policies for performance-critical sections and dynamic policies for less critical, more flexible parts of the code:

```cpp
template<typename StaticPolicy>
class HybridAlgorithm {
private:
    std::unique_ptr<Policy> dynamicPolicy_;

public:
    void setDynamicPolicy(std::unique_ptr<Policy> policy) {
        dynamicPolicy_ = std::move(policy);
    }

    void execute() {
        StaticPolicy::apply();
        if (dynamicPolicy_) {
            dynamicPolicy_->apply();
        }
    }
};

class StaticPolicyA {
public:
    static void apply() {
        std::cout << "Applying Static Policy A" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    HybridAlgorithm<StaticPolicyA> algorithm;
    
    algorithm.execute(); // Output: Applying Static Policy A
    
    algorithm.setDynamicPolicy(std::make_unique<PolicyB>());
    algorithm.execute(); // Output: Applying Static Policy A \n Applying Policy B
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `HybridAlgorithm` class is parameterized with a static policy and can set a dynamic policy at runtime. The `execute` method applies both the static and dynamic policies.

#### Handling Configurations with Dynamic Policy Selection

In real-world applications, dynamic policy selection is often driven by configurations or external inputs. Modern C++ patterns typically read these configurations from files, databases, or user inputs and adjust the behavior of the system dynamically.

```cpp
class ConfigurationManager {
public:
    static std::unique_ptr<Policy> getConfiguredPolicy() {
        // Assume configurations are read from a file or input
        std::string config = readConfiguration();
        if (config == "A") {
            return std::make_unique<PolicyA>();
        } else if (config == "B") {
            return std::make_unique<PolicyB>();
        } else {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Unknown policy type");
        }
    }

private:
    static std::string readConfiguration() {
        // Dummy implementation for example
        return "A"; // In a real scenario, this might come from a file or input
    }
};

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<Policy> policy = ConfigurationManager::getConfiguredPolicy();
    policy->apply(); // Output based on configuration

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `ConfigurationManager` reads the configuration and returns the appropriate policy object. The main function then applies the configured policy.

#### Advantages and Trade-offs of Dynamic Policy Selection

**Advantages**:
1. **Flexibility**: Policies can be changed without recompiling the program.
2. **Adaptability**: Programs can adjust to different conditions or inputs at runtime.
3. **Configurability**: Applications can be configured via external inputs or user preferences, making them more versatile and user-friendly.

**Trade-offs**:
1. **Performance Overheads**: Dynamic dispatch and polymorphism can introduce runtime overheads.
2. **Type Safety**: Fewer compile-time checks can lead to potential runtime errors.
3. **Memory Usage**: Additional memory is needed to store metadata such as vtables and base pointers.

#### Summary

Dynamic policy selection in C++ offers unparalleled flexibility by enabling runtime decision-making. While it introduces certain performance and type safety trade-offs, it is indispensable for scenarios requiring adaptability and configurability. By leveraging polymorphism, factory patterns, the strategy pattern, and type erasure, dynamic policies can be effectively integrated into C++ applications. Often, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both static and dynamic policy selection provides the best of both worlds, balancing performance with flexibility to create robust and adaptive software solutions.

### Practical Examples

#### Introduction to Practical Examples

In the previous subchapters, we have explored the theoretical underpinnings of both static and dynamic policy selection, discussed their advantages and trade-offs, and examined various implementation techniques. Now, it is time to delve into practical examples to anchor these concepts in real-world scenarios. Through these examples, we aim to illustrate how policy-based design principles can be applied to build robust and flexible C++ applications. This chapter will cover different use cases, from optimizing algorithms and managing resources to configuring system behaviors and enhancing software modularity.

#### Example 1: Optimizing Sorting Algorithms

One of the classic examples of policy-based design is optimizing sorting algorithms by selecting different comparison policies. This example demonstrates both static and dynamic policy selection for sorting.

**Static Policy Selection:**
In this approach, we use template parameters to select the comparison policy at compile-time.

```cpp
template<typename Comparator>
void sort(std::vector<int>& data) {
    std::sort(data.begin(), data.end(), Comparator());
}

struct Ascending {
    bool operator()(int a, int b) const {
        return a < b;
    }
};

struct Descending {
    bool operator()(int a, int b) const {
        return a > b;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {5, 2, 9, 1, 3};
    
    // Using Ascending policy
    sort<Ascending>(data);
    
    // data is now sorted in ascending order: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
    
    // Using Descending policy
    sort<Descending>(data);
    
    // data is now sorted in descending order: {9, 5, 3, 2, 1}
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Dynamic Policy Selection:**
Here, we use polymorphism to select the comparison policy at runtime.

```cpp
class Comparator {
public:
    virtual ~Comparator() = default;
    virtual bool compare(int a, int b) const = 0;
};

class Ascending : public Comparator {
public:
    bool compare(int a, int b) const override {
        return a < b;
    }
};

class Descending : public Comparator {
public:
    bool compare(int a, int b) const override {
        return a > b;
    }
};

void sort(std::vector<int>& data, const Comparator& comparator) {
    std::sort(data.begin(), data.end(), [&](int a, int b) {
        return comparator.compare(a, b);
    });
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {5, 2, 9, 1, 3};
    
    Ascending ascending;
    Descending descending;
    
    // Using Ascending policy
    sort(data, ascending);
    
    // data is now sorted in ascending order: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
    
    // Using Descending policy
    sort(data, descending);
    
    // data is now sorted in descending order: {9, 5, 3, 2, 1}
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 2: Resource Management in a Memory Pool

Memory pools are efficient for scenarios that require frequent allocation and deallocation of small objects. By selecting allocation and deallocation policies, we can optimize the memory pool's performance.

**Static Policy Selection:**

```cpp
template<typename AllocationPolicy, typename DeallocationPolicy>
class MemoryPool : private AllocationPolicy, private DeallocationPolicy {
public:
    void* allocate(size_t size) {
        return AllocationPolicy::allocate(size);
    }

    void deallocate(void* ptr) {
        DeallocationPolicy::deallocate(ptr);
    }
};

struct DefaultAllocation {
    static void* allocate(size_t size) {
        return ::operator new(size);
    }
};

struct DefaultDeallocation {
    static void deallocate(void* ptr) {
        ::operator delete(ptr);
    }
};

struct DebugDeallocation {
    static void deallocate(void* ptr) {
        std::cout << "Deallocating memory at " << ptr << std::endl;
        ::operator delete(ptr);
    }
};

int main() {
    MemoryPool<DefaultAllocation, DefaultDeallocation> pool;
    void* ptr = pool.allocate(128);
    pool.deallocate(ptr);

    MemoryPool<DefaultAllocation, DebugDeallocation> debugPool;
    ptr = debugPool.allocate(256);
    debugPool.deallocate(ptr);

    return 0;
}
```

**Dynamic Policy Selection:**

```cpp
class AllocationPolicy {
public:
    virtual ~AllocationPolicy() = default;
    virtual void* allocate(size_t size) const = 0;
};

class DeallocationPolicy {
public:
    virtual ~DeallocationPolicy() = default;
    virtual void deallocate(void* ptr) const = 0;
};

class DefaultAllocation : public AllocationPolicy {
public:
    void* allocate(size_t size) const override {
        return ::operator new(size);
    }
};

class DefaultDeallocation : public DeallocationPolicy {
public:
    void deallocate(void* ptr) const override {
        ::operator delete(ptr);
    }
};

class DebugDeallocation : public DeallocationPolicy {
public:
    void deallocate(void* ptr) const override {
        std::cout << "Deallocating memory at " << ptr << std::endl;
        ::operator delete(ptr);
    }
};

class MemoryPool {
private:
    const AllocationPolicy& allocPolicy_;
    const DeallocationPolicy& deallocPolicy_;

public:
    MemoryPool(const AllocationPolicy& allocPolicy, const DeallocationPolicy& deallocPolicy)
        : allocPolicy_(allocPolicy), deallocPolicy_(deallocPolicy) {}

    void* allocate(size_t size) {
        return allocPolicy_.allocate(size);
    }

    void deallocate(void* ptr) {
        deallocPolicy_.deallocate(ptr);
    }
};

int main() {
    DefaultAllocation defaultAlloc;
    DefaultDeallocation defaultDealloc;
    DebugDeallocation debugDealloc;

    MemoryPool pool(defaultAlloc, defaultDealloc);
    void* ptr = pool.allocate(128);
    pool.deallocate(ptr);

    MemoryPool debugPool(defaultAlloc, debugDealloc);
    ptr = debugPool.allocate(256);
    debugPool.deallocate(ptr);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 3: Configuring System Behavior

Many applications require configurable behavior based on user preferences, system settings, or runtime conditions. Policy-based design enables such configurability in a structured and maintainable way.

**Static Policy Selection:**

In a file logger scenario, where we want to configure the log format statically, we can use templates:

```cpp
template<typename FormatPolicy>
class Logger {
public:
    void log(const std::string& message) {
        std::cout << FormatPolicy::format(message) << std::endl;
    }
};

struct PlainFormat {
    static std::string format(const std::string& message) {
        return message;
    }
};

struct TimestampFormat {
    static std::string format(const std::string& message) {
        time_t now = time(0);
        char* dt = ctime(&now);
        std::string timestampedMessage = "[";
        timestampedMessage += std::string(dt).substr(0, 24) + "] " + message;
        return timestampedMessage;
    }
};

int main() {
    Logger<PlainFormat> plainLogger;
    plainLogger.log("This is a plain message");

    Logger<TimestampFormat> timestampLogger;
    timestampLogger.log("This is a timestamped message");

    return 0;
}
```

**Dynamic Policy Selection:**

```cpp
class FormatPolicy {
public:
    virtual ~FormatPolicy() = default;
    virtual std::string format(const std::string& message) const = 0;
};

class PlainFormat : public FormatPolicy {
public:
    std::string format(const std::string& message) const override {
        return message;
    }
};

class TimestampFormat : public FormatPolicy {
public:
    std::string format(const std::string& message) const override {
        time_t now = time(0);
        char* dt = ctime(&now);
        std::string timestampedMessage = "[";
        timestampedMessage += std::string(dt).substr(0, 24) + "] " + message;
        return timestampedMessage;
    }
};

class Logger {
private:
    const FormatPolicy& formatPolicy_;

public:
    Logger(const FormatPolicy& formatPolicy)
        : formatPolicy_(formatPolicy) {}

    void log(const std::string& message) {
        std::cout << formatPolicy_.format(message) << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    PlainFormat plainFormat;
    TimestampFormat timestampFormat;

    Logger plainLogger(plainFormat);
    plainLogger.log("This is a plain message");

    Logger timestampLogger(timestampFormat);
    timestampLogger.log("This is a timestamped message");

    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 4: Enhancing Modularity in Software Design

Policy-based design can significantly enhance the modularity of a software system, improving maintainability and allowing for easier future extensions. Let’s consider a payment processing system that supports multiple payment gateways.

**Static Policy Selection:**

```cpp
template<typename PaymentGateway>
class PaymentProcessor {
public:
    void processPayment(double amount) {
        PaymentGateway::process(amount);
    }
};

struct PayPalGateway {
    static void process(double amount) {
        std::cout << "Processing $" << amount << " through PayPal" << std::endl;
    }
};

struct StripeGateway {
    static void process(double amount) {
        std::cout << "Processing $" << amount << " through Stripe" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    PaymentProcessor<PayPalGateway> paypalProcessor;
    paypalProcessor.processPayment(100.0);

    PaymentProcessor<StripeGateway> stripeProcessor;
    stripeProcessor.processPayment(150.0);

    return 0;
}
```

**Dynamic Policy Selection:**

```cpp
class PaymentGateway {
public:
    virtual ~PaymentGateway() = default;
    virtual void process(double amount) const = 0;
};

class PayPalGateway : public PaymentGateway {
public:
    void process(double amount) const override {
        std::cout << "Processing $" << amount << " through PayPal" << std::endl;
    }
};

class StripeGateway : public PaymentGateway {
public:
    void process(double amount) const override {
        std::cout << "Processing $" << amount << " through Stripe" << std::endl;
    }
};

class PaymentProcessor {
private:
    const PaymentGateway& gateway_;

public:
    PaymentProcessor(const PaymentGateway& gateway)
        : gateway_(gateway) {}

    void processPayment(double amount) const {
        gateway_.process(amount);
    }
};

int main() {
    PayPalGateway paypalGateway;
    StripeGateway stripeGateway;

    PaymentProcessor paypalProcessor(paypalGateway);
    paypalProcessor.processPayment(100.0);

    PaymentProcessor stripeProcessor(stripeGateway);
    stripeProcessor.processPayment(150.0);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 5: Integrating with Legacy Systems

When integrating with legacy systems, policies can simplify the adaptation layer between the new code and the legacy codebase. Let’s consider an example where we need to integrate a new system with legacy data formats.

**Static Policy Selection:**

```cpp
template<typename DataFormatPolicy>
class DataProcessor {
public:
    void processData(const std::string& data) {
        std::string processedData = DataFormatPolicy::convert(data);
        // Process the converted data
        std::cout << "Processed Data: " << processedData << std::endl;
    }
};

struct LegacyFormat {
    static std::string convert(const std::string& data) {
        // Conversion logic for legacy data format
        return "Legacy: " + data;
    }
};

struct ModernFormat {
    static std::string convert(const std::string& data) {
        // Conversion logic for modern data format
        return "Modern: " + data;
    }
};

int main() {
    DataProcessor<LegacyFormat> legacyProcessor;
    legacyProcessor.processData("Sample Data");

    DataProcessor<ModernFormat> modernProcessor;
    modernProcessor.processData("Sample Data");

    return 0;
}
```

**Dynamic Policy Selection:**

```cpp
class DataFormatPolicy {
public:
    virtual ~DataFormatPolicy() = default;
    virtual std::string convert(const std::string& data) const = 0;
};

class LegacyFormat : public DataFormatPolicy {
public:
    std::string convert(const std::string& data) const override {
        // Conversion logic for legacy data format
        return "Legacy: " + data;
    }
};

class ModernFormat : public DataFormatPolicy {
public:
    std::string convert(const std::string& data) const override {
        // Conversion logic for modern data format
        return "Modern: " + data;
    }
};

class DataProcessor {
private:
    const DataFormatPolicy& formatPolicy_;

public:
    DataProcessor(const DataFormatPolicy& formatPolicy)
        : formatPolicy_(formatPolicy) {}

    void processData(const std::string& data) const {
        std::string processedData = formatPolicy_.convert(data);
        // Process the converted data
        std::cout << "Processed Data: " << processedData << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    LegacyFormat legacyFormat;
    ModernFormat modernFormat;

    DataProcessor legacyProcessor(legacyFormat);
    legacyProcessor.processData("Sample Data");

    DataProcessor modernProcessor(modernFormat);
    modernProcessor.processData("Sample Data");

    return 0;
}
```

#### Advantages and Considerations in Practical Use

**Advantages:**
1. **Modularity**: Policies encapsulate specific behavior, leading to modular and maintainable code.
2. **Reusability**: Policies can be reused across different contexts, promoting code reuse.
3. **Testability**: Each policy can be tested independently, resulting in better test coverage and easier debugging.
4. **Flexibility**: Dynamic policies offer greater flexibility to adapt the behavior of the system at runtime.
5. **Optimization**: Static policies allow for compile-time optimizations, enhancing performance and type safety.

**Considerations:**
1. **Complexity**: Introducing policies can increase the complexity of the codebase, making it harder to understand for newcomers.
2. **Performance Overheads**: Dynamic policy selection introduces runtime overheads due to dynamic dispatch and memory allocation.
3. **Maintenance**: Managing a large number of policies can be challenging and may require careful documentation and organization.

#### Summary

This chapter has provided extensive examples of both static and dynamic policy selection as applied to various real-world scenarios. From optimizing algorithms and managing resources to configuring system behaviors and enhancing modularity, policy-based design proves to be a versatile and powerful technique in C++. By understanding and employing these principles, developers can create more efficient, flexible, and maintainable software systems. Whether choosing compile-time optimizations with static policies or runtime adaptability with dynamic policies, the key is to select the appropriate approach based on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.
