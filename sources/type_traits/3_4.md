## 14. Policy-Based Design Patterns

In this chapter, we delve into some key design patterns that embody the essence of Policy-Based Design. These patterns provide structured solutions to common software design problems while promoting flexibility and maintainability. We will explore the Strategy Pattern and the Policy Adapter Pattern, both of which leverage policies to enable runtime and compile-time behavior customization, respectively. By examining these patterns through practical, illustrative examples, we aim to demonstrate how they can be effectively applied in real-world scenarios, harnessing the power of C++'s type traits and advanced template metaprogramming techniques.

### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a design pattern used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime, emphasizing the separation of concerns and promoting code reusability and flexibility. The Strategy Pattern falls under the behavioral design patterns category and is particularly useful for systems that need to change their algorithms dynamically.

#### 1. Introduction to the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is instrumental in scenarios where a class should have its algorithm or behavior dynamically changeable. By encapsulating algorithms in separate classes, the Strategy Pattern adheres to the Open/Closed Principle, one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. This principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, the Strategy Pattern allows new algorithms to be added without altering the existing classes' code.

#### 2. Structure of the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern involves the following components:

1. **Strategy Interface (`IStrategy`)**: An interface common to all supported algorithms. This interface is used by the context object to call the algorithm defined by a particular concrete strategy.
2. **Concrete Strategies (`ConcreteStrategyA`, `ConcreteStrategyB`, etc.)**: Classes that implement the Strategy interface. Each concrete strategy encapsulates an algorithm or behavior.
3. **Context (`Context`)**: Maintains a reference to a strategy object. The context delegates the algorithm to the strategy object it refers to, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from the context.

#### 3. Formal Analysis of the Strategy Pattern

##### 3.1 Strategy Interface

The Strategy Interface defines a method common to all concrete strategies. This interface ensures that the context can use different strategies interchangeably. In C++, this can be achieved using pure virtual functions:

```cpp
class IStrategy {
public:
    virtual ~IStrategy() = default;
    virtual void execute() const = 0;
};
```

##### 3.2 Concrete Strategies

Concrete Strategies implement the Strategy interface and define the specific algorithm or behavior. Each class provides a specific implementation of the `execute` method:

```cpp
class ConcreteStrategyA : public IStrategy {
public:
    void execute() const override {
        // Implementation of algorithm A
    }
};

class ConcreteStrategyB : public IStrategy {
public:
    void execute() const override {
        // Implementation of algorithm B
    }
};
```

##### 3.3 Context

The context is responsible for maintaining a reference to one of the strategy objects and delegating the execution to the current strategy:

```cpp
class Context {
private:
    IStrategy* strategy_;
public:
    explicit Context(IStrategy* strategy) : strategy_(strategy) {}
    void set_strategy(IStrategy* strategy) {
        strategy_ = strategy;
    }
    void execute_strategy() const {
        strategy_->execute();
    }
};
```

#### 4. Applicability and Benefits

The Strategy Pattern is applicable in situations where:

- Many related classes differ only in their behavior. Strategies provide a way to configure a class with one of many behaviors.
- Different variants of an algorithm are needed and should be interchangeable.
- The algorithm's client should not expose complex and algorithm-specific data structures.

The primary benefits of the Strategy Pattern include:

- **Flexibility**: The Strategy Pattern allows swapping algorithms or behaviors transparently at runtime without altering the context.
- **Maintainability**: New algorithms can be introduced without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Testability**: Algorithms can be tested independently, leading to more modular and tested code.

#### 5. Relation to Other Patterns

The Strategy Pattern is often compared with the following design patterns:

- **State Pattern**: Both the Strategy Pattern and the State Pattern involve defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating them, and making them interchangeable. The primary difference is that the State Pattern is typically used to change behaviors at runtime in reaction to specific events, simulating state transitions in a state machine. The Strategy Pattern is used when the behavior needs to be selected dynamically based on a particular criterion.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Whereas the Strategy Pattern changes the entire algorithm, the Decorator Pattern enhances or modifies the behavior of an object by adding more responsibilities. The Strategy Pattern encapsulates the changeable part of the algorithm.
- **Command Pattern**: The Strategy and Command patterns involve encapsulating behavior, but the Command Pattern is geared towards encapsulating actions or operations, allowing them to be parameterized and dynamic solution invocation.

#### 6. Practical Examples

Practically, the Strategy Pattern is prevalent in software development for sorting algorithms, data compression strategies, or any scenario necessitating algorithm selection at runtime. Consider the case of a payment system that supports multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.). Each payment method can be encapsulated as a concrete strategy:

```cpp
class PaymentStrategy {
public:
    virtual ~PaymentStrategy() = default;
    virtual void pay(int amount) const = 0;
};

class CreditCardPayment : public PaymentStrategy {
public:
    void pay(int amount) const override {
        // Implementation for credit card payment
    }
};

class PaypalPayment : public PaymentStrategy {
public:
    void pay(int amount) const override {
        // Implementation for PayPal payment
    }
};

class ShoppingCart {
private:
    PaymentStrategy* payment_strategy_;
public:
    explicit ShoppingCart(PaymentStrategy* payment_strategy) : payment_strategy_(payment_strategy) {}
    void set_payment_strategy(PaymentStrategy* payment_strategy) {
        payment_strategy_ = payment_strategy;
    }
    void checkout(int amount) const {
        payment_strategy_->pay(amount);
    }
};
```

In this example, the `ShoppingCart` class is the context, maintaining a reference to a `PaymentStrategy`. Concrete strategies (`CreditCardPayment`, `PaypalPayment`) implement the `PaymentStrategy` interface, and their specific algorithms can be chosen dynamically, demonstrating the Strategy Pattern's flexibility and efficiency.

#### 7. Summary

The Strategy Pattern encapsulates a family of algorithms, designating interfaces and switching algorithms dynamically. It adheres to the SOLID principles, especially the Open/Closed Principle, fostering maintainability, testability, and flexibility in software design. By following the Strategy Pattern, developers can architect systems that are extensible and easy to refactor, pivotal in modern software engineering.

The Strategy Pattern's thorough comprehension and adept application can significantly enhance a C++ developer's toolkit, providing robust solutions for dynamic behavior and algorithm selection while promoting clean and maintainable code architectures.

### Policy Adapter Pattern

The Policy Adapter Pattern is a powerful design technique that augments the flexibility of Policy-Based Design by adapting existing policies to new interfaces or contexts. This pattern allows developers to take advantage of established policy classes while providing a means to integrate them into systems with different requirements. By doing so, the Policy Adapter Pattern supports interface compatibility and reuse, reduces redundancy, and ensures code extensibility.

#### 1. Introduction to the Policy Adapter Pattern

The Policy Adapter Pattern is an adaptation of the classical Adapter Pattern, which allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. In the context of Policy-Based Design, a policy adapter modifies the interface of a policy class to match the expectations of a context or another policy class. This means an existing policy with a specific interface can be adapted to a new interface required in different contexts without modifying the original policy class.

Using the Policy Adapter Pattern allows separation of concerns, promoting flexibility and reuse. One can adopt this pattern to integrate different policies seamlessly into a system, ensuring that they work harmoniously while maintaining the integrity of the original policy implementations.

#### 2. Structure of the Policy Adapter Pattern

The Policy Adapter Pattern involves several key components:

1. **Target Policy Interface (`ITargetPolicy`)**: The interface that the context expects the policy to conform to.
2. **Adaptee Policy Class (`AdapteePolicy`)**: An existing policy class with an interface inconsistent with the target interface.
3. **Policy Adapter (`PolicyAdapter`)**: A class that implements the target policy interface and internally holds an instance of the adaptee policy. It adapts the interface of the adaptee to meet the target policy interface requirements.
4. **Context (`Context`)**: The context that interacts with the target policy interface, not knowing it is using an adapted policy.

#### 3. Formal Analysis of the Policy Adapter Pattern

##### 3.1 Target Policy Interface

The target policy interface defines the methods that the context will call. This interface needs to be compatible with the context's requirements. In C++, this can be designed as an abstract class with pure virtual functions:

```cpp
class ITargetPolicy {
public:
    virtual ~ITargetPolicy() = default;
    virtual void performAction() const = 0;
};
```

##### 3.2 Adaptee Policy Class

The adaptee is an existing policy class that does not conform to the target policy interface. It contains its own methods, data, and logic:

```cpp
class AdapteePolicy {
public:
    void specificAction() const {
        // Implementation of the adaptee's specific action
    }
};
```

##### 3.3 Policy Adapter

The policy adapter implements the target policy interface and internally holds a reference to the adaptee. It translates method calls from the target policy interface to the appropriate methods of the adaptee:

```cpp
class PolicyAdapter : public ITargetPolicy {
private:
    const AdapteePolicy& adaptee_;
public:
    explicit PolicyAdapter(const AdapteePolicy& adaptee) : adaptee_(adaptee) {}

    void performAction() const override {
        adaptee_.specificAction();  // Adapting the call
    }
};
```

##### 3.4 Context

The context interacts with policies through the target policy interface, ignorant of whether it is dealing with an adapted policy:

```cpp
class Context {
private:
    ITargetPolicy* policy_;
public:
    explicit Context(ITargetPolicy* policy) : policy_(policy) {}

    void execute() const {
        policy_->performAction();
    }
};
```

#### 4. Applicability and Benefits

The Policy Adapter Pattern is suitable in scenarios where:

- Extending the functionality of systems using existing policy classes without modifying their source code is required.
- Bridging policies with incompatible interfaces is essential to achieve integration in a new context.
- Following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is critical, by modularizing interface adaptation separately from the core logic.

The primary benefits of the Policy Adapter Pattern include:

- **Interface Compatibility**: This pattern enables different interfaces to work together, thus ensuring that systems with disparate interfaces can interact seamlessly.
- **Reusability**: Existing policy classes can be reused in new contexts without changing their implementation, encouraging code reuse.
- **Extensibility**: New policy adapters can be introduced with minimal changes to the existing system, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Maintainability**: Policies and their adapters are maintained separately, simplifying changes and modularizing the adaptation logic.

#### 5. Relation to Other Patterns

The Policy Adapter Pattern shares similarities and differences with other design patterns:

- **Adapter Pattern**: The Policy Adapter Pattern is an application of the Adapter Pattern within the context of Policy-Based Design. Both patterns aim to make incompatible interfaces compatible.
- **Strategy Pattern**: While the Strategy Pattern is about interchangeable algorithms or behaviors, the Policy Adapter Pattern focuses on adapting the interfaces of policy classes to new contexts or other policies.
- **Decorator Pattern**: The Decorator Pattern adds responsibilities to an object dynamically, while the Policy Adapter Pattern reshapes the interface of a policy for compatibility purposes.

#### 6. Practical Examples

Consider an example in a graphics rendering system where different rendering policies (e.g., OpenGL, Direct3D) exist with different interfaces. Assume we need to integrate a legacy OpenGL rendering policy into a system designed to work with a more abstract rendering interface. Here’s how the Policy Adapter Pattern can be applied:

**Target Policy Interface:**

```cpp
class IRenderPolicy {
public:
    virtual ~IRenderPolicy() = default;
    virtual void render() const = 0;
};
```

**Adaptee Policy Class:**

```cpp
class OpenGLRenderPolicy {
public:
    void executeOpenGLRendering() const {
        // OpenGL-specific rendering implementation
    }
};
```

**Policy Adapter:**

```cpp
class OpenGLAdapter : public IRenderPolicy {
private:
    const OpenGLRenderPolicy& opengl_policy_;
public:
    explicit OpenGLAdapter(const OpenGLRenderPolicy& opengl_policy) 
        : opengl_policy_(opengl_policy) {}

    void render() const override {
        opengl_policy_.executeOpenGLRendering(); // Adapt the call
    }
};
```

**Context:**

```cpp
class Renderer {
private:
    IRenderPolicy* render_policy_;
public:
    explicit Renderer(IRenderPolicy* render_policy) : render_policy_(render_policy) {}

    void renderFrame() const {
        render_policy_->render();
    }
};
```

Here, the `Renderer` class can work with any rendering policy conforming to `IRenderPolicy`. By introducing `OpenGLAdapter`, we can integrate our `OpenGLRenderPolicy` seamlessly without modifying its implementation.

#### 7. Summary

The Policy Adapter Pattern is a critical tool in the arsenal of design patterns, enabling the seamless integration of policies with different interfaces. It achieves this by adapting the interface of an existing policy to a new target interface expected by a context, ensuring compatibility, reuse, and maintainability of code.

Understanding and applying the Policy Adapter Pattern is essential for developers seeking to create flexible and extensible software systems. By leveraging this pattern, complex systems can incorporate legacy or external policies efficiently, fostering a modular design approach that aligns with modern software engineering principles.

### Practical Examples

The theoretical foundation and structure of Policy-Based Design Patterns, such as the Strategy Pattern and the Policy Adapter Pattern, are crucial to understanding their capabilities and advantages. However, their real power becomes evident when applied to practical, real-world problems. This chapter provides a deep dive into several detailed, practical examples illustrating how these design patterns can be used to solve complex software engineering challenges. Each example will not only demonstrate the mechanics of these patterns but also highlight their benefits and usage scenarios.

#### Example 1: Payment Processing System

In a modern e-commerce application, payment processing needs to be flexible to support multiple payment methods like credit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrencies. This flexibility can be elegantly achieved using the Strategy Pattern, where each payment method is encapsulated as a strategy.

##### 1.1 The Strategy Interface

First, define a common interface for all payment strategies:

```cpp
class IPaymentStrategy {
public:
    virtual ~IPaymentStrategy() = default;
    virtual void pay(double amount) const = 0;
};
```

##### 1.2 Concrete Payment Strategies

Then implement concrete strategies for each payment method:

```cpp
class CreditCardPayment : public IPaymentStrategy {
public:
    void pay(double amount) const override {
        // Implementation for credit card payment
    }
};

class PayPalPayment : public IPaymentStrategy {
public:
    void pay(double amount) const override {
        // Implementation for PayPal payment
    }
};

class CryptoPayment : public IPaymentStrategy {
public:
    void pay(double amount) const override {
        // Implementation for cryptocurrency payment
    }
};
```

##### 1.3 The Context Class

The `PaymentProcessor` class acts as the context and uses a strategy to process a payment:

```cpp
class PaymentProcessor {
private:
    IPaymentStrategy* strategy_;
public:
    explicit PaymentProcessor(IPaymentStrategy* strategy) 
        : strategy_(strategy) {}

    void set_payment_strategy(IPaymentStrategy* strategy) {
        strategy_ = strategy;
    }

    void process_payment(double amount) const {
        strategy_->pay(amount);
    }
};
```

##### 1.4 Using the Payment Processor

Instantiate the context with a particular strategy and switch strategies dynamically if needed:

```cpp
int main() {
    CreditCardPayment credit_card_payment;
    PayPalPayment paypal_payment;
    CryptoPayment crypto_payment;

    PaymentProcessor processor(&credit_card_payment);
    processor.process_payment(150.0); // Pays with credit card

    processor.set_payment_strategy(&paypal_payment);
    processor.process_payment(75.0); // Pays with PayPal

    processor.set_payment_strategy(&crypto_payment);
    processor.process_payment(60.0); // Pays with cryptocurrency

    return 0;
}
```

This example illustrates the Strategy Pattern's ability to dynamically change algorithms (payment methods) transparently at runtime. This approach adheres to the Open/Closed Principle by allowing new payment methods to be added with minimal changes to the existing code.

#### Example 2: Graphics Rendering with Policy Adapter Pattern

In a graphics rendering engine, different rendering policies such as OpenGL, Direct3D, and Vulkan may be needed. These rendering policies might have different interfaces, thus requiring adaptation using the Policy Adapter Pattern.

##### 2.1 Target Policy Interface

Define a common interface for rendering policies:

```cpp
class IRenderPolicy {
public:
    virtual ~IRenderPolicy() = default;
    virtual void render_frame() const = 0;
};
```

##### 2.2 Adaptee Policy Classes

Existing rendering policies with their respective methods:

```cpp
class OpenGLRenderPolicy {
public:
    void execute_opengl_rendering() const {
        // OpenGL-specific rendering implementation
    }
};

class Direct3DRenderPolicy {
public:
    void execute_direct3d_rendering() const {
        // Direct3D-specific rendering implementation
    }
};
```

##### 2.3 Policy Adapters

Adapt the existing policies to the target interface:

```cpp
class OpenGLAdapter : public IRenderPolicy {
private:
    const OpenGLRenderPolicy& opengl_policy_;
public:
    explicit OpenGLAdapter(const OpenGLRenderPolicy& opengl_policy) 
        : opengl_policy_(opengl_policy) {}

    void render_frame() const override {
        opengl_policy_.execute_opengl_rendering();
    }
};

class Direct3DAdapter : public IRenderPolicy {
private:
    const Direct3DRenderPolicy& direct3d_policy_;
public:
    explicit Direct3DAdapter(const Direct3DRenderPolicy& direct3d_policy)
        : direct3d_policy_(direct3d_policy) {}

    void render_frame() const override {
        direct3d_policy_.execute_direct3d_rendering();
    }
};
```

##### 2.4 Context Class

The `Renderer` class uses the `IRenderPolicy` interface to render frames:

```cpp
class Renderer {
private:
    IRenderPolicy* render_policy_;
public:
    explicit Renderer(IRenderPolicy* render_policy) 
        : render_policy_(render_policy) {}

    void set_render_policy(IRenderPolicy* render_policy) {
        render_policy_ = render_policy;
    }

    void render() const {
        render_policy_->render_frame();
    }
};
```

##### 2.5 Using the Renderer

Instantiate the renderer with different policies:

```cpp
int main() {
    OpenGLRenderPolicy opengl_policy;
    Direct3DRenderPolicy direct3d_policy;

    OpenGLAdapter opengl_adapter(opengl_policy);
    Direct3DAdapter direct3d_adapter(direct3d_policy);

    Renderer renderer(&opengl_adapter);
    renderer.render(); // Uses OpenGL rendering

    renderer.set_render_policy(&direct3d_adapter);
    renderer.render(); // Switches to Direct3D rendering

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates how the Policy Adapter Pattern allows different rendering policies to be used interchangeably by adapting their interfaces, promoting flexibly and reuse without altering the original policy classes.

#### Example 3: Logging System with Strategy and Policy Adapter Patterns

Logging is a critical component in software systems, often requiring different logging strategies (e.g., console logging, file logging, and network logging). Sometimes, integrating existing logging libraries with different interfaces is necessary.

##### 3.1 Strategy Interface for Logging

Define a common interface for logging strategies:

```cpp
class ILoggerStrategy {
public:
    virtual ~ILoggerStrategy() = default;
    virtual void log(const std::string& message) const = 0;
};
```

##### 3.2 Concrete Logging Strategies

Implement different logging strategies:

```cpp
class ConsoleLogger : public ILoggerStrategy {
public:
    void log(const std::string& message) const override {
        std::cout << "Console log: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

class FileLogger : public ILoggerStrategy {
public:
    void log(const std::string& message) const override {
        // Implementation for logging to a file
    }
};

class NetworkLogger : public ILoggerStrategy {
public:
    void log(const std::string& message) const override {
        // Implementation for logging over the network
    }
};
```

##### 3.3 Integrating an External Logging Library with Policy Adapter

Assume an existing external logging library with a different interface:

```cpp
class ExternalLoggingLibrary {
public:
    void external_log(const std::string& msg) const {
        // External logging implementation
    }
};
```

Create an adapter to integrate this external library:

```cpp
class ExternalLoggerAdapter : public ILoggerStrategy {
private:
    const ExternalLoggingLibrary& external_logger_;
public:
    explicit ExternalLoggerAdapter(const ExternalLoggingLibrary& external_logger)
        : external_logger_(external_logger) {}

    void log(const std::string& message) const override {
        external_logger_.external_log(message);
    }
};
```

##### 3.4 Logger Context

A Logger class that uses the ILoggerStrategy interface:

```cpp
class Logger {
private:
    ILoggerStrategy* logger_strategy_;
public:
    explicit Logger(ILoggerStrategy* logger_strategy) 
        : logger_strategy_(logger_strategy) {}

    void set_logger_strategy(ILoggerStrategy* logger_strategy) {
        logger_strategy_ = logger_strategy;
    }

    void log_message(const std::string& message) const {
        logger_strategy_->log(message);
    }
};
```

##### 3.5 Using the Logger

Instantiate the Logger with different strategies:

```cpp
int main() {
    ConsoleLogger console_logger;
    FileLogger file_logger;
    NetworkLogger network_logger;

    ExternalLoggingLibrary external_library;
    ExternalLoggerAdapter external_adapter(external_library);

    Logger logger(&console_logger);
    logger.log_message("This is a console log"); // Logs to console

    logger.set_logger_strategy(&file_logger);
    logger.log_message("This is a file log"); // Logs to file

    logger.set_logger_strategy(&network_logger);
    logger.log_message("This is a network log"); // Logs to network

    logger.set_logger_strategy(&external_adapter);
    logger.log_message("This is an external log"); // Logs using external library

    return 0;
}
```

This example showcases the use of both the Strategy Pattern and the Policy Adapter Pattern in a logging system. The Strategy Pattern enables flexible switching of logging strategies, while the Policy Adapter Pattern integrates an external logging library with a different interface.

#### Example 4: Dynamic Behavior Customization in an AI Bot

Consider an AI bot where different strategies for pathfinding, enemy engagement, and resource gathering are needed based on the game scenario. These strategies can change dynamically during gameplay, making the AI bot highly adaptable.

##### 4.1 Strategy Interfaces

Define common interfaces for various behaviors:

```cpp
class IPathfindingStrategy {
public:
    virtual ~IPathfindingStrategy() = default;
    virtual void find_path() const = 0;
};

class IEngagementStrategy {
public:
    virtual ~IEngagementStrategy() = default;
    virtual void engage_enemy() const = 0;
};

class IGatheringStrategy {
public:
    virtual ~IGatheringStrategy() = default;
    virtual void gather_resources() const = 0;
};
```

##### 4.2 Concrete Strategies for Behaviors

Implement different strategies for each behavior:

```cpp
class AStarPathfinding : public IPathfindingStrategy {
public:
    void find_path() const override {
        // Implementation of A* pathfinding
    }
};

class DijkstraPathfinding : public IPathfindingStrategy {
public:
    void find_path() const override {
        // Implementation of Dijkstra's pathfinding
    }
};

class AggressiveEngagement : public IEngagementStrategy {
public:
    void engage_enemy() const override {
        // Implementation of aggressive engagement
    }
};

class DefensiveEngagement : public IEngagementStrategy {
public:
    void engage_enemy() const override {
        // Implementation of defensive engagement
    }
};

class SimpleGathering : public IGatheringStrategy {
public:
    void gather_resources() const override {
        // Implementation of simple gathering
    }
};

class EfficientGathering : public IGatheringStrategy {
public:
    void gather_resources() const override {
        // Implementation of efficient gathering
    }
};
```

##### 4.3 AI Bot Context

The `AIBot` class uses these strategies to exhibit different behaviors:

```cpp
class AIBot {
private:
    IPathfindingStrategy* pathfinding_strategy_;
    IEngagementStrategy* engagement_strategy_;
    IGatheringStrategy* gathering_strategy_;
public:
    AIBot(IPathfindingStrategy* pathfinding, IEngagementStrategy* engagement, IGatheringStrategy* gathering)
        : pathfinding_strategy_(pathfinding), engagement_strategy_(engagement), gathering_strategy_(gathering) {}

    void set_pathfinding_strategy(IPathfindingStrategy* pathfinding) {
        pathfinding_strategy_ = pathfinding;
    }

    void set_engagement_strategy(IEngagementStrategy* engagement) {
        engagement_strategy_ = engagement;
    }

    void set_gathering_strategy(IGatheringStrategy* gathering) {
        gathering_strategy_ = gathering;
    }

    void perform_pathfinding() const {
        pathfinding_strategy_->find_path();
    }

    void perform_engagement() const {
        engagement_strategy_->engage_enemy();
    }

    void perform_gathering() const {
        gathering_strategy_->gather_resources();
    }
};
```

##### 4.4 Using the AI Bot

Instantiate and dynamically switch strategies for the AI bot:

```cpp
int main() {
    AStarPathfinding a_star;
    DijkstraPathfinding dijkstra;
    AggressiveEngagement aggressive;
    DefensiveEngagement defensive;
    SimpleGathering simple_gathering;
    EfficientGathering efficient_gathering;

    AIBot bot(&a_star, &aggressive, &simple_gathering);
    bot.perform_pathfinding(); // Uses A* pathfinding
    bot.perform_engagement();  // Uses aggressive engagement
    bot.perform_gathering();   // Uses simple gathering

    bot.set_pathfinding_strategy(&dijkstra);
    bot.set_engagement_strategy(&defensive);
    bot.set_gathering_strategy(&efficient_gathering);

    bot.perform_pathfinding(); // Switches to Dijkstra's pathfinding
    bot.perform_engagement();  // Switches to defensive engagement
