# Part III: Quantum Information Theory

## 9. Quantum Information Basics

As we venture into the heart of quantum information theory, we lay the essential groundwork necessary to grasp the deeper intricacies of quantum computing and its vast potential. This chapter, "Quantum Information Basics," delves into the fundamental concepts that form the foundation of this revolutionary field. We begin with an exploration of quantum bits, or qubits, and quantum registers, highlighting their unique properties and how they differ from classical bits. Next, we examine density matrices and mixed states, which provide a robust framework for understanding the behavior of quantum systems in various states of coherence and decoherence. Finally, we introduce quantum entropy and various information measures, which are crucial for quantifying and analyzing the information-carrying capacity of quantum systems. Through this chapter, we aim to equip readers with a strong conceptual framework to appreciate the elegance and power of quantum information theory, setting the stage for more advanced topics that follow.

### Quantum Bits and Quantum Registers

In classical computing, the fundamental unit of information is the bit, which can exist in one of two distinct states: 0 or 1. This binary system forms the basis of all classical computation, enabling operations and expressions of complex algorithms through combinations of bits. However, quantum computing introduces a new paradigm with the concept of the quantum bit, or qubit. Qubits form the cornerstone of quantum information theory and quantum computation, possessing properties that transcend their classical counterparts, enabling powerful computational capabilities that classical bits cannot achieve.

#### Properties of Qubits

A qubit can be in a state |0⟩, a state $|1⟩$, or any quantum superposition of these states. Mathematically, a general qubit state $|\psi⟩$ can be written as:
$$ | \psi \rangle = \alpha | 0 \rangle + \beta | 1 \rangle $$
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers known as probability amplitudes. These amplitudes must satisfy the normalization condition:
$$ |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1 $$
This expresses the fundamental principle that the total probability of all possible outcomes must sum to one. The state of a qubit is represented as a point on the Bloch sphere, a unit sphere in a three-dimensional space, where the angles of latitude and longitude on the sphere correspond to the amplitudes $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

#### Superposition and Measurement

The principle of superposition allows a qubit to simultaneously exist in a combination of states |0⟩ and |1⟩. However, upon measurement, the qubit collapses to one of the basis states, either |0⟩ or |1⟩, with probabilities given by $|\alpha|^2$ and $|\beta|^2$, respectively. This probabilistic nature imbues quantum computing with its unique characteristics, where computations are not deterministic as in classical computing but rather follow quantum mechanical principles.

#### Quantum Registers

A quantum register is a collection of qubits, analogous to a classical register which is an array of bits. If a quantum register consists of $n$ qubits, the state of the register can be a superposition of all 2^n possible $n$-bit strings. The state of a quantum register can be described as:
$$ | \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{2^n - 1} \alpha_i | i \rangle $$
where $| i \rangle$ represents the computational basis states of the $n$-qubit system, and $\alpha_i$ are complex probability amplitudes satisfying the normalization condition:
$$ \sum_{i=0}^{2^n - 1} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1 $$

For example, in a 2-qubit system, the state can be expressed as:
$$ | \psi \rangle = \alpha_{00} | 00 \rangle + \alpha_{01} | 01 \rangle + \alpha_{10} | 10 \rangle + \alpha_{11} | 11 \rangle $$

#### Entanglement

One of the most profound features of quantum mechanics utilized in quantum computing is entanglement. When qubits become entangled, the state of one qubit is intrinsically linked to the state of another, no matter the distance separating them. This linkage creates correlations between entangled qubits that are stronger than any classical correlation, a phenomenon Einstein famously referred to as "spooky action at a distance."

A prominent example of an entangled state is the Bell state:
$$ | \Phi^+ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| 00 \rangle + | 11 \rangle) $$
In this entangled state, measuring the first qubit immediately determines the state of the second qubit, regardless of the physical distance between them. This property is critical in various quantum algorithms and protocols like quantum teleportation and superdense coding.

#### Quantum Gates and Circuits

Quantum computation is realized by manipulating qubits using quantum gates. These gates are the quantum analogs of classical logic gates and perform operations on qubits through unitary transformations. Some common single-qubit quantum gates include:

- **Pauli-X Gate (Quantum NOT Gate)**
  $$
  X = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
  1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$

- **Hadamard Gate**
  $$
  H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 1 \\
  1 & -1
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$

The Hadamard gate creates superposition states from classical basis states, for example:
$$ H | 0 \rangle = \frac{| 0 \rangle + | 1 \rangle}{\sqrt{2}} $$

Multi-qubit operations, such as the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, play a crucial role in quantum circuits:
$$
\text{CNOT} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Quantum circuits are constructed by concatenating quantum gates to implement complex algorithms. They are typically represented as sequences of gate operations acting on qubit registers.

#### Quantum Circuit Example in Python

Here is a simple example of a quantum circuit implemented using the `Qiskit` library in Python, which sets up a quantum register, applies a Hadamard gate to put a qubit in superposition, and subsequently entangles two qubits using a CNOT gate:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

# Initialize a quantum circuit with 2 qubits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)

# Apply Hadamard gate to the first qubit to create superposition
qc.h(0)  # H gate on qubit 0

# Apply CNOT gate with the first qubit as control and second qubit as target
qc.cx(0, 1)  # CNOT gate: control qubit 0, target qubit 1

# Draw the circuit
print(qc.draw())

# Simulate the quantum circuit
backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
result = execute(qc, backend).result()

# Show the state vector result
statevector = result.get_statevector()
print("Statevector:", statevector)
```

Upon running this code, the resulting state vector should reflect an entangled state, similar to the Bell state described earlier.

#### Conclusion

The investigation of qubits and quantum registers opens the door to understanding the essential components of quantum computation. With their abilities to exist in superposition states and become entangled, qubits empower quantum computers to process and solve problems in a manner fundamentally different from classical computers. The manipulation of qubits using quantum gates within quantum circuits forms the basis of quantum algorithms, enabling breakthroughs across fields such as cryptography, optimization, and material science. Understanding these fundamental building blocks is crucial for delving deeper into the applications and implications of quantum computing.

### Density Matrices and Mixed States

In quantum mechanics, the concept of a pure state, as represented by a state vector $|\psi\rangle$, is central to understanding the deterministic evolution and measurement outcomes of isolated quantum systems. However, real-world quantum systems rarely exist in pure states due to interactions with their environments and other external factors. These interactions often lead to a loss of coherence, resulting in what is known as mixed states. The mathematical framework that encompasses both pure and mixed states is the density matrix formalism.

#### Density Matrices

A density matrix (or density operator) $\rho$ is a powerful tool for describing the statistical state of a quantum system, whether it is in a pure or mixed state. For a quantum system described by the states $|\psi_i\rangle$ with corresponding probabilities $p_i$, the density matrix is defined as:
$$ \rho = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i \rangle \langle \psi_i | $$

In the case of a pure state $|\psi\rangle$, the density matrix simplifies to:
$$ \rho = |\psi\rangle \langle \psi | $$

The density matrix $\rho$ satisfies the following properties:
1. **Trace**: The trace of $\rho$, denoted $\text{Tr}(\rho)$, is equal to unity.
   $$ \text{Tr}(\rho) = 1 $$
2. **Hermiticity**: $\rho$ is a Hermitian operator.
   $$ \rho = \rho^\dagger $$
3. **Positivity**: $\rho$ is a positive semi-definite operator, meaning that $\langle \psi | \rho | \psi \rangle \geq 0$ for all $|\psi\rangle$.
4. **Eigenvalues**: The eigenvalues of $\rho$ lie in the interval $[0, 1]$.

#### Mixed States

Mixed states describe quantum systems that are in a statistical ensemble of pure states. Unlike pure states, where the system can be described by a single state vector, mixed states require a probabilistic representation. For example, consider a system that has a 50% probability of being in state $|\psi_1\rangle$ and a 50% probability of being in state $|\psi_2\rangle$. The corresponding density matrix is:
$$ \rho = \frac{1}{2} |\psi_1\rangle \langle \psi_1| + \frac{1}{2} |\psi_2\rangle \langle \psi_2| $$

Mixed states arise naturally in many situations, such as when the exact preparation of the quantum state is not known, or when the system is entangled with another system and one considers only the subsystem.

#### Pure vs. Mixed States

A key distinction between pure and mixed states can be made by examining the trace of $\rho^2$:
- For a pure state $|\psi\rangle$, $\rho = |\psi\rangle \langle \psi|$, and $\rho^2 = \rho$. Thus, $\text{Tr}(\rho^2) = 1$.
- For a mixed state, $\text{Tr}(\rho^2) < 1$.

#### Example Calculation: Bell State

Consider the Bell state, a maximally entangled state involving two qubits:
$$ |\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle) $$

The density matrix for this pure state is:
$$ \rho_{\Phi^+} = |\Phi^+\rangle \langle \Phi^+| $$

Expanding this explicitly:
$$ \rho_{\Phi^+} = \frac{1}{2} (|00\rangle \langle 00| + |00\rangle \langle 11| + |11\rangle \langle 00| + |11\rangle \langle 11| ) $$

If one of the qubits is traced out, the remaining qubit is described by a reduced density matrix. This process of tracing out part of the system is known as the partial trace.

#### Partial Trace and Reduced Density Matrix

Given a composite system of two subsystems A and B described by the density matrix $\rho_{AB}$, the reduced density matrix for subsystem A, $\rho_A$, is obtained by tracing out subsystem B:
$$ \rho_A = \text{Tr}_B(\rho_{AB}) $$

For the Bell state example, tracing out one qubit results in a reduced density matrix that represents a maximally mixed state:
$$ \rho_A = \text{Tr}_B(\rho_{\Phi^+}) = \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|) $$

The reduced density matrix $\rho_A$ indicates that subsystem A is in a maximally mixed state, with equal probabilities of being in the states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.

#### Quantum Operations in the Density Matrix Formalism

Quantum operations, including measurements, unitary transformations, and decoherence processes, can all be represented within the density matrix framework.

- **Unitary Transformations**: If the quantum system undergoes a unitary transformation $U$, the density matrix evolves as:
  $$ \rho \rightarrow U \rho U^\dagger $$

- **Measurements**: Consider a measurement described by a set of projection operators $\{P_i\}$. The probability $p_i$ of obtaining the $i$-th measurement outcome is:
  $$ p_i = \text{Tr}(P_i \rho) $$
  Post-measurement, the state of the system becomes:
  $$ \rho_i = \frac{P_i \rho P_i}{p_i} $$

- **Decoherence**: Decoherence is the process by which a quantum system loses its coherent superposition states due to interaction with its environment. A common model for decoherence is the dephasing channel, where the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix decay over time.

#### Bloch's Representation for Mixed States

The Bloch vector representation provides a geometrical interpretation of the density matrix for single-qubit systems. Any single-qubit density matrix can be written in the form:
$$ \rho = \frac{1}{2}(I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}) $$
where $I$ is the identity matrix, $\vec{r}$ is the Bloch vector, and $\vec{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)$ are the Pauli matrices. The Bloch vector describes the state of the qubit in a three-dimensional vector space, constrained by $|\vec{r}| \leq 1$.

- For pure states, $|\vec{r} | = 1$.
- For mixed states, $|\vec{r} | < 1$.

#### Example Calculation in Python

Let's compute the density matrix and reduced density matrix for a quantum system using Python and the `Qiskit` library:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.quantum_info import DensityMatrix, partial_trace

# Create a Bell state
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)  # Apply Hadamard gate on qubit 0
qc.cx(0, 1)  # Apply CNOT gate with qubit 0 as control and qubit 1 as target

# Convert the quantum state to a density matrix
backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
result = execute(qc, backend).result()
statevector = result.get_statevector()
density_matrix = DensityMatrix(statevector)

# Print the density matrix
print("Density Matrix of Bell State:")
print(density_matrix)

# Compute the reduced density matrix by tracing out one qubit
reduced_density_matrix = partial_trace(density_matrix, [1])  # Trace out qubit 1

# Print the reduced density matrix
print("Reduced Density Matrix:")
print(reduced_density_matrix)
```

This code sets up a Bell state, converts the state vector to a density matrix, and calculates the partial trace to get the reduced density matrix.

#### Conclusion

The density matrix formalism is a powerful framework for understanding quantum systems, extending the concept of quantum states to encompass both pure and mixed states. It provides a comprehensive description of the statistical properties of quantum systems, enabling the analysis of complex phenomena such as decoherence and entanglement. Mastery of this formalism is essential for any foray into advanced quantum information theory and quantum computing, as it bridges the gap between theoretical constructs and practical, real-world quantum systems.

### Quantum Entropy and Information Measures

Quantum information theory draws heavily from classical information theory but must account for the rich and complex phenomena that arise due to the principles of quantum mechanics. At its core, quantum entropy measures the uncertainty or disorder within a quantum system, and it plays a crucial role in quantum information measures, quantum communications, and quantum thermodynamics. In this chapter, we explore various forms of quantum entropy, such as von Neumann entropy, and delve into their applications in quantum information theory.

#### Classical Information Theory Recap

Shannon entropy is a fundamental concept in classical information theory, capturing the amount of uncertainty in a probabilistic system. For a discrete random variable X with probability distribution $\{p_i\}$, the Shannon entropy $H(X)$ is given by:
$$ H(X) = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i $$

#### Von Neumann Entropy

The von Neumann entropy extends the concept of Shannon entropy to the realm of quantum systems. For a quantum system described by a density matrix $\rho$, the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho)$ is defined as:
$$ S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \log \rho) $$

The von Neumann entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty or mixedness in the quantum state. For pure states, the von Neumann entropy is zero, reflecting no uncertainty since the state is well-defined. For mixed states, the entropy is positive, capturing the degree of uncertainty.

To compute $S(\rho)$, we consider the eigenvalues $\{\lambda_i\}$ of the density matrix $\rho$:
$$ S(\rho) = -\sum_i \lambda_i \log \lambda_i $$

#### Example: Entropy of a Bell State

Consider the Bell state $|\Phi^+\rangle$:
$$ |\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle) $$

The density matrix for this pure state is:
$$ \rho_{\Phi^+} = |\Phi^+\rangle \langle \Phi^+| $$

Since this is a pure state, the von Neumann entropy is zero:
$$ S(\rho_{\Phi^+}) = 0 $$

However, if we look at the reduced density matrix of one of the qubits (as shown previously), it represents a maximally mixed state:
$$ \rho_A = \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|) $$

The eigenvalues of $\rho_A$ are both $\frac{1}{2}$, so the von Neumann entropy is:
$$ S(\rho_A) = -\left( \frac{1}{2} \log \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \log \frac{1}{2} \right) = \log 2 $$

#### Quantum Relative Entropy

Quantum Relative Entropy extends the classical Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantum systems, providing a measure of distinguishability between two quantum states. For two density matrices $\rho$ and $\sigma$, the quantum relative entropy $S(\rho \| \sigma)$ is defined as:
$$ S(\rho \| \sigma) = \text{Tr}(\rho (\log \rho - \log \sigma)) $$

Quantum relative entropy is always non-negative and is zero if and only if $\rho = \sigma$.

#### Mutual Information

Quantum mutual information quantifies the total correlations (both classical and quantum) between two subsystems A and B of a composite system described by a density matrix $\rho_{AB}$. It is defined as:
$$ I(A:B) = S(\rho_A) + S(\rho_B) - S(\rho_{AB}) $$

where $\rho_A = \text{Tr}_B(\rho_{AB})$ and $\rho_B = \text{Tr}_A(\rho_{AB})$ are the reduced density matrices.

#### Example: Mutual Information for a Bell State

Consider again the Bell state $|\Phi^+\rangle$. The reduced density matrices for either qubit are maximally mixed states with von Neumann entropy $S(\rho_A) = S(\rho_B) = \log 2$:

However, the entropy $S(\rho_{AB})$ of the entire Bell state, which is a pure state, is zero: $S(\rho_{AB}) = 0$.

Therefore, the mutual information is:
$$ I(A:B) = \log 2 + \log 2 - 0 = 2 \log 2 $$
This indicates strong correlations between the subsystems A and B.

#### Conditional Entropy and Coherent Information

Conditional entropy in the classical context measures the average uncertainty remaining in a variable $Y$ given the knowledge of another variable $X$. In the quantum scenario, the conditional entropy $S(A|B)$ is defined as:
$$ S(A|B) = S(\rho_{AB}) - S(\rho_B) $$

However, unlike its classical counterpart, the quantum conditional entropy can be negative, signifying the presence of quantum entanglement.

Coherent information $I_c(A\rangle B)$ is a key quantity in quantum information theory used to evaluate the amount of quantum information that can be transmitted. It is defined as:
$$ I_c(A\rangle B) = S(\rho_B) - S(\rho_{AB}) $$

If $I_c(A\rangle B) > 0$, it indicates that quantum information can be successfully transmitted from A to B.

#### Quantum Channel Capacities

Quantum channel capacity is a measure of the maximum rate at which quantum information can be reliably transmitted through a quantum channel. Several types of capacities are of interest:

- **Classical Capacity $C$**: The maximum rate at which classical information can be sent through a quantum channel.
- **Quantum Capacity $Q$**: The maximum rate at which quantum information can be sent through a quantum channel.
- **Private Classical Capacity $P$**: The maximum rate of private classical communication through a quantum channel.

The Holevo bound provides an upper limit to the capacity of transmitting classical information through a quantum channel:
$$ \chi = S\left( \sum_i p_i \rho_i \right) - \sum_i p_i S(\rho_i) $$

where $\{p_i, \rho_i\}$ are the probabilities and density matrices of the signal states.

#### Example Calculation: Holevo Bound in Python

Let's illustrate the Holevo bound calculation using Python and the `Qiskit` library:

```python
from qiskit.quantum_info import entropy, partial_trace, Statevector

# Define the mixed state for example
p = 0.5
rho1 = Statevector.from_label('0').to_operator()
rho2 = Statevector.from_label('1').to_operator()

# Create the overall mixed state
rho_mix = p * rho1 + (1 - p) * rho2

# Compute the entropies
S_rho_mix = entropy(rho_mix)
S_rho1 = entropy(rho1)
S_rho2 = entropy(rho2)

# Holevo bound calculation
Holevo_bound = S_rho_mix - (p * S_rho1 + (1 - p) * S_rho2)
print("Holevo Bound:", Holevo_bound)
```

In this example, we can observe how the entropy measurements are combined to calculate the Holevo bound, providing an estimate of the maximum amount of classical information that can be reliably transmitted through a specific quantum channel.

#### Conclusion

Quantum entropy and information measures form the bedrock of quantum information theory. They allow us to quantify the uncertainty, correlations, and information-carrying capacity of quantum systems and channels. Understanding these concepts is essential for applications ranging from quantum communications to quantum cryptography and quantum computing. As we continue to explore the nuances of quantum entropy and information measures, we unlock deeper layers of understanding about the capabilities and limitations of quantum technologies.
