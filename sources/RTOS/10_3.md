### Sample Programs Demonstrating Key Concepts

In this chapter, we will delve into a series of sample programs that illustrate fundamental concepts of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS). Each example is meticulously crafted to elucidate specific mechanisms critical to RTOS, such as task scheduling, inter-task communication, synchronization mechanisms, and handling real-time constraints. This detailed exposition will not only aid you in understanding how these concepts are implemented but also provide practical coding patterns that can be adapted for your own projects.

#### 1. Task Scheduling

**Task scheduling** is an essential feature of RTOS. It ensures that tasks are executed in a timely manner according to their priority and deadlines. RTOS typically employs preemptive or cooperative scheduling algorithms to manage task execution.

##### Example: Preemptive Task Scheduling

In a preemptive scheduler, higher-priority tasks can preempt currently running lower-priority tasks. Below is a C++ example demonstrating a simple preemptive scheduling mechanism using FreeRTOS.

```cpp
#include <FreeRTOS.h>
#include <task.h>

// Function prototypes for tasks
void vTask1(void* pvParameters);
void vTask2(void* pvParameters);

// Define two tasks with different priorities
int main() {
    // Create task 1 with high priority
    xTaskCreate(vTask1, "Task 1", 1000, NULL, 2, NULL);
    // Create task 2 with low priority
    xTaskCreate(vTask2, "Task 2", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL);
    
    // Start the scheduler
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    // Main should never reach here
    for (;;);
}

void vTask1(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        // Simulate task workload
        printf("Task 1 is running\n");
        // Delay to allow lower priority tasks to execute
        vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}

void vTask2(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        // Simulate task workload
        printf("Task 2 is running\n");
        // Delay to simulate periodic task execution
        vTaskDelay(500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **xTaskCreate**: This function creates two tasks—`vTask1` with higher priority (2) and `vTask2` with lower priority (1).
2. **vTaskStartScheduler**: Starts the RTOS scheduler. After this call, tasks begin execution based on their priority.
3. **vTaskDelay**: Introduces a delay in task execution, allowing other tasks to run. This is crucial for simulating periodic behavior in tasks.

#### 2. Inter-Task Communication

**Inter-task communication** is vital for tasks to exchange information and synchronize their operations. Common mechanisms include queues, mailboxes, and signals.

##### Example: Queue Communication

Queues allow tasks to send and receive data in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. Here’s a C++ example using FreeRTOS:

```cpp
#include <FreeRTOS.h>
#include <task.h>
#include <queue.h>

// Function prototypes for tasks
void vSenderTask(void* pvParameters);
void vReceiverTask(void* pvParameters);

// Queue handle
QueueHandle_t xQueue;

int main() {
    // Create a queue to hold 10 integer values
    xQueue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(int));
    
    // Check if the queue was created successfully
    if (xQueue != NULL) {
        // Create the sender and receiver tasks
        xTaskCreate(vSenderTask, "Sender", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL);
        xTaskCreate(vReceiverTask, "Receiver", 1000, NULL, 2, NULL);
        
        // Start the scheduler
        vTaskStartScheduler();
    }

    // Main should never reach here
    for (;;);
}

void vSenderTask(void* pvParameters) {
    int valueToSend = 0;
    for (;;) {
        // Send an integer value to the queue every 200ms
        xQueueSend(xQueue, &valueToSend, portMAX_DELAY);
        printf("Sent: %d\n", valueToSend);
        valueToSend++;
        vTaskDelay(200 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}

void vReceiverTask(void* pvParameters) {
    int receivedValue;
    for (;;) {
        // Receive a value from the queue
        xQueueReceive(xQueue, &receivedValue, portMAX_DELAY);
        printf("Received: %d\n", receivedValue);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **xQueueCreate**: Creates a queue capable of holding 10 integers.
2. **xQueueSend**: Sends an integer to the queue, blocking if the queue is full (`portMAX_DELAY`).
3. **xQueueReceive**: Receives an integer from the queue, blocking if the queue is empty (`portMAX_DELAY`).

#### 3. Synchronization Mechanisms

Synchronization mechanisms ensure that tasks do not interfere with each other when accessing shared resources. Common synchronization primitives include semaphores and mutexes.

##### Example: Binary Semaphore

A binary semaphore is akin to a lock and can be used to signal between tasks or interrupt service routines (ISRs).

```cpp
#include <FreeRTOS.h>
#include <task.h>
#include <semphr.h>

// Function prototypes for tasks
void vTask(void* pvParameters);
void vInterruptServiceRoutine(void);

// Semaphore handle
SemaphoreHandle_t xBinarySemaphore;

int main() {
    // Create a binary semaphore
    xBinarySemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateBinary();
    
    // Check if the semaphore was created successfully
    if (xBinarySemaphore != NULL) {
        // Create the task
        xTaskCreate(vTask, "Task", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL);
        
        // Start the scheduler
        vTaskStartScheduler();
    }

    // Main should never reach here
    for (;;);
}

void vTask(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        // Wait for the semaphore to become available
        if (xSemaphoreTake(xBinarySemaphore, portMAX_DELAY)) {
            // Critical section: protected access to shared resource
            printf("Semaphore taken by task\n");
        }
    }
}

void vInterruptServiceRoutine(void) {
    // ISR code...
    
    // Give the semaphore to unblock the task
    xSemaphoreGiveFromISR(xBinarySemaphore, NULL);
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **xSemaphoreCreateBinary**: Creates a binary semaphore.
2. **xSemaphoreTake**: Task waits for the semaphore to become available.
3. **xSemaphoreGiveFromISR**: ISR gives the semaphore, unblocking the waiting task.

#### 4. Real-Time Clock and Timers

**Real-time clock (RTC) and timers** are crucial for tasks that need to maintain time references or perform timeout operations.

##### Example: Timer-Based Execution

Hardware timers or software timers can be employed to schedule tasks or issue time-based callbacks.

```cpp
#include <FreeRTOS.h>
#include <task.h>
#include <timers.h>

// Timer handle and callback function
void vTimerCallback(TimerHandle_t xTimer);

int main() {
    // Create a software timer
    TimerHandle_t xTimer = xTimerCreate("Timer", 1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS, pdTRUE, (void*)0, vTimerCallback);
    
    // Check if timer was created successfully
    if (xTimer != NULL) {
        // Start the timer with a period of 1000ms
        xTimerStart(xTimer, 0);
        
        // Start the scheduler
        vTaskStartScheduler();
    }

    // Main should never reach here
    for (;;);
}

void vTimerCallback(TimerHandle_t xTimer) {
    // Timer callback function executed periodically
    printf("Timer callback executed\n");
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **xTimerCreate**: Creates a periodic software timer with a callback.
2. **xTimerStart**: Starts the timer. The callback function `vTimerCallback` is called every 1000ms.

#### 5. Event Handling

**Event handling** is a mechanism to synchronize tasks, which can wait for one or more events to occur.

##### Example: Event Groups

Event groups allow tasks to wait for a combination of events. Below is a C++ example using FreeRTOS:

```cpp
#include <FreeRTOS.h>
#include <task.h>
#include <event_groups.h>

// Event group handle
EventGroupHandle_t xEventGroup;

// Event bit definitions
#define BIT_0 (1 << 0)
#define BIT_1 (1 << 1)

// Function prototypes for tasks
void vTask1(void* pvParameters);
void vTask2(void* pvParameters);

int main() {
    // Create an event group
    xEventGroup = xEventGroupCreate();
    
    // Check if event group was created successfully
    if (xEventGroup != NULL) {
        // Create the tasks
        xTaskCreate(vTask1, "Task 1", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL);
        xTaskCreate(vTask2, "Task 2", 1000, NULL, 2, NULL);
        
        // Start the scheduler
        vTaskStartScheduler();
    }

    // Main should never reach here
    for (;;);
}

void vTask1(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        // Set the event bits
        xEventGroupSetBits(xEventGroup, BIT_0 | BIT_1);
        printf("Task 1 set bits\n");
        vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}

void vTask2(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        // Wait for both bits to be set
        EventBits_t uxBits = xEventGroupWaitBits(xEventGroup, BIT_0 | BIT_1, pdTRUE, pdTRUE, portMAX_DELAY);
        if ((uxBits & (BIT_0 | BIT_1)) == (BIT_0 | BIT_1)) {
            printf("Task 2 received bits\n");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **xEventGroupCreate**: Creates an event group.
2. **xEventGroupSetBits**: Task 1 sets the event bits.
3. **xEventGroupWaitBits**: Task 2 waits for both bits to be set before proceeding.

### Exercises for Practice

In this subchapter, we present a series of exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of the essential concepts discussed in previous sections. These exercises range from basic tasks to more advanced problems, challenging you to apply your knowledge of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) in practical scenarios. Each exercise is accompanied by a detailed description, and where necessary, we will provide insights into the solution approach.

#### 1. Task Creation and Scheduling

**Exercise 1.1:** Implement a simple RTOS application where three tasks of different priorities are created. Task 1 should run every second, Task 2 every two seconds, and Task 3 should run as often as possible without blocking other tasks.

**Objective:** Understand the creation of tasks and the impact of priority on scheduling.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Initialize an RTOS environment (e.g., FreeRTOS).
2. Define task functions for Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3.
3. Assign different priorities to each task.
4. Utilize `vTaskDelay` for periodic execution in Task 1 and Task 2.
5. Start the scheduler and observe the task execution order.

```cpp
void vTask1(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        // Perform Task 1 operations
        // Delay for 1000ms
        vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}

// Define similar structures for Task 2 and Task 3

int main() {
    // Create tasks with different priorities
    xTaskCreate(vTask1, "Task 1", 1000, NULL, HIGH_PRIORITY, NULL);
    xTaskCreate(vTask2, "Task 2", 1000, NULL, MEDIUM_PRIORITY, NULL);
    xTaskCreate(vTask3, "Task 3", 1000, NULL, LOW_PRIORITY, NULL);

    // Start the scheduler
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    for (;;);
}
```

**Expected Outcome:** High-priority Task 1 should run every second, medium-priority Task 2 should run every two seconds, and Task 3 should run whenever there is idle CPU time.

#### 2. Inter-Task Communication with Queues

**Exercise 2.1:** Create an RTOS application where Task A generates data and sends it to Task B via a queue. Task B processes the data and prints the results.

**Objective:** Gain hands-on experience with queue-based inter-task communication.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Define Task A for data generation and Task B for data processing.
2. Create a queue capable of holding a predefined number of data items.
3. Implement `xQueueSend` in Task A to send data.
4. Implement `xQueueReceive` in Task B to receive and process data.
5. Start the scheduler and observe the communication flow.

```cpp
void vTaskA(void* pvParameters) {
    int data = 0;
    for (;;) {
        xQueueSend(xQueue, &data, portMAX_DELAY);
        data++;
        vTaskDelay(100 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}

void vTaskB(void* pvParameters) {
    int receivedData;
    for (;;) {
        xQueueReceive(xQueue, &receivedData, portMAX_DELAY);
        printf("Processed data: %d", receivedData);
    }
}
```

**Expected Outcome:** Task A should send data periodically, and Task B should process and print the data.

#### 3. Synchronization Using Semaphores

**Exercise 3.1:** Implement a binary semaphore to synchronize two tasks. Task 1 should signal Task 2 to start processing after completing its own operations.

**Objective:** Learn how to use binary semaphores for task synchronization.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Create a binary semaphore.
2. Implement Task 1 to perform operations and then signal Task 2.
3. Implement Task 2 to wait for the semaphore and then start processing.
4. Start the scheduler and verify the synchronization.

```cpp
void vTask1(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        // Perform operations
        xSemaphoreGive(xBinarySemaphore);
        vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}

void vTask2(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        xSemaphoreTake(xBinarySemaphore, portMAX_DELAY);
        // Start processing after receiving semaphore signal
    }
}
```

**Expected Outcome:** Task 2 should wait for a signal from Task 1 before starting its processing.

#### 4. Handling Periodic Events with Timers

**Exercise 4.1:** Create an application that uses a software timer to toggle an LED every 500ms.

**Objective:** Understand the use of software timers for generating periodic events.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Initialize a timer with a period of 500ms.
2. Define a callback function to toggle the LED.
3. Start the timer and observe the LED toggling behavior.

**Pseudocode:**
```cpp
void vTimerCallback(TimerHandle_t xTimer) {
    // Toggle LED state
}

int main() {
    // Create and start the timer
    TimerHandle_t xTimer = xTimerCreate("LED Timer", 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS, pdTRUE, 0, vTimerCallback);
    xTimerStart(xTimer, 0);

    // Start the scheduler
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    for (;;);
}
```

**Expected Outcome:** The LED should toggle its state every 500ms.

#### 5. Creating and Managing Event Groups

**Exercise 5.1:** Construct an RTOS application using event groups. Task 1 and Task 2 should set different bits of an event group, and Task 3 should take action when both bits are set.

**Objective:** Create and manage event groups for task synchronization based on multiple events.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Create an event group.
2. Implement Task 1 to set BIT_0 and Task 2 to set BIT_1.
3. Implement Task 3 to wait for both BIT_0 and BIT_1 to be set.
4. Start the scheduler to orchestrate the task operations.

```cpp
void vTask1(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        xEventGroupSetBits(xEventGroup, BIT_0);
        vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}

void vTask2(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        xEventGroupSetBits(xEventGroup, BIT_1);
        vTaskDelay(2000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}

void vTask3(void* pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        xEventGroupWaitBits(xEventGroup, BIT_0 | BIT_1, pdTRUE, pdTRUE, portMAX_DELAY);
        // Perform action after both bits are set
    }
}
```

**Expected Outcome:** Task 3 should only execute its action after both Task 1 and Task 2 have set their respective bits in the event group.

#### 6. Handling Real-Time Constraints

**Exercise 6.1:** Implement a periodic task that must complete its operations within a specific deadline. If the task exceeds the deadline, it should log a deadline miss event.

**Objective:** Learn to manage real-time constraints and monitor deadline adherence.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Define a periodic task with a stringent execution time constraint.
2. Measure task execution time and compare it against the deadline.
3. Log any deadline misses.

```cpp
void vTimedTask(void* pvParameters) {
    TickType_t xLastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();
    const TickType_t xFrequency = 500; // 500ms period

    for (;;) {
        // Perform operations
        if (/* operations exceeded deadline */) {
            // Log deadline miss
        }
        vTaskDelayUntil(&xLastWakeTime, xFrequency);
    }
}
```

**Expected Outcome:** The task should periodically execute, and any deadline misses should be logged.
