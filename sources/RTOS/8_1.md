# Part VIII: Popular RTOS Platforms

## 21. FreeRTOS

FreeRTOS is one of the most widely used Real-Time Operating Systems in the embedded systems domain, celebrated for its simplicity, reliability, and extensive community support. Originally developed by Richard Barry and now backed by Amazon Web Services, FreeRTOS offers a robust platform for developers to build real-time applications across a multitude of microcontroller and processor architectures. This chapter will delve into the architecture and core features of FreeRTOS, provide a step-by-step guide to getting started with the platform, and explore advanced techniques for optimizing and enhancing FreeRTOS-based applications. Whether you're a novice eager to grasp the basics or a seasoned developer seeking to deepen your expertise, this chapter will equip you with the knowledge needed to effectively leverage FreeRTOS in your projects.

### Architecture and Features

FreeRTOS is structured to offer a minimalist, efficient, and portable real-time kernel suitable for microcontrollers and small microprocessors. Its architecture emphasizes the separation of concerns, modularity, and ease of integration, making it adaptable to a wide range of hardware platforms. This chapter delves into the intricate architecture and standout features that make FreeRTOS a popular choice for developers needing a real-time operating system.

#### Core Components of FreeRTOS

At its core, FreeRTOS is composed of several integral components, each playing a crucial role in its operation:

1. **Kernel**: The kernel is the heart of FreeRTOS, responsible for managing tasks, scheduling, and inter-task communication. It ensures that real-time constraints are met and that tasks are executed in a predictable manner.

2. **Tasks**: Tasks in FreeRTOS are the basic unit of execution. A task is akin to a thread in conventional operating systems. Each task has its own stack, priority level, and state information. Tasks can be in one of several states: running, ready, blocked, suspended, or deleted.

3. **Scheduler**: The scheduler is responsible for deciding which task should be executing at any given time. FreeRTOS supports both preemptive and cooperative scheduling models. The preemptive scheduler can interrupt a running task to switch to a higher-priority task, ensuring that high-priority tasks meet their deadlines.

4. **Queues**: Queues in FreeRTOS are used for inter-task communication and synchronization. They allow tasks and interrupts to send and receive data in a thread-safe manner. FreeRTOS queues are designed to be efficient and versatile, enabling multiple data items to be queued and de-queued in a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) manner.

5. **Semaphores**: Semaphores are synchronization primitives that are vital for managing access to shared resources and synchronizing tasks. FreeRTOS provides several types of semaphores, including binary semaphores, counting semaphores, and mutexes (mutual exclusions).

6. **Timers**: FreeRTOS includes software timers that allow functions to be executed at specific time intervals. These timers can be configured to run once or repeatedly and can be started, stopped, reset, or changed dynamically.

7. **Event Groups**: Event groups are used for synchronization between tasks or between tasks and interrupts. They provide an efficient way of signaling and waiting for multiple events.

#### Task Management

Tasks in FreeRTOS are structured entities containing:

- **Task Control Block (TCB)**: This is the data structure that holds information about the task such as its state, stack pointer, priority, and other metadata.
- **Task Stack**: Each task has its own stack, which is used to hold its local variables, function call return addresses, and CPU registers. The stack size for each task is configured at creation.

A task is created using the `xTaskCreate` function, which initializes the TCB and allocates stack space. Here's an example of creating a simple task:

```c++
void vTaskCode(void *pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        // Task code goes here
    }
}

void main() {
    xTaskCreate(vTaskCode,       // Function to implement the task
                "TaskName",      // Name of the task
                1000,            // Task stack size
                NULL,            // Parameter to pass to the task
                1,               // Task priority
                NULL);           // Task handle
    vTaskStartScheduler();       // Start the scheduler
}
```

In this example, `vTaskCode` is the function that implements the task. The task runs indefinitely, as indicated by the infinite loop within `vTaskCode`.

#### Scheduling Mechanisms

FreeRTOS supports several scheduling mechanisms:

- **Preemptive Scheduling**: In this mode, the highest-priority task that is ready to run will always be given CPU time. If a higher-priority task becomes ready while a lower-priority task is running, the scheduler will preempt the running task. This is essential for meeting stringent real-time constraints.

- **Time Slicing**: When multiple tasks of the same priority are ready to run, time slicing ensures that each task is given an equal share of CPU time. Tasks are switched in a round-robin fashion typically controlled by a periodic timer interrupt.

- **Cooperative Scheduling**: In cooperative scheduling, a running task must explicitly yield control back to the scheduler. This mode is less common due to its reliance on well-behaved tasks and can lead to less predictable execution times.

The scheduling algorithm in FreeRTOS utilizes a priority-based scheme augmented by a ready list and a blocked list. Each priority level has its own ready list, and tasks are scheduled from the highest-priority ready list first.

#### Inter-Task Communication

Inter-task communication in FreeRTOS is facilitated via queues, semaphores, and event groups:

- **Queues**: Queues are used to pass data between tasks or between interrupts and tasks safely. Tasks can block on queue read or write operations until the queue is ready to perform the operation. This blocking mechanism is crucial for reducing CPU idle time and ensuring efficient task execution.

For instance, a task sending a value to a queue can use:

```c++
xQueueSend(xQueue, &valueToSend, portMAX_DELAY);
```

- **Binary and Counting Semaphores**: These are used for signaling between tasks or between interrupts and tasks. A binary semaphore is ideal for signaling the occurrence of a single event, while a counting semaphore can keep track of multiple events.

Example usage of a binary semaphore:

```c++
xSemaphoreTake(xBinarySemaphore, portMAX_DELAY);
```

- **Mutexes**: Mutexes are a specialized form of semaphore used to manage mutually exclusive access to resources. They incorporate a priority inheritance mechanism, which helps to mitigate priority inversion problems.

```c++
xSemaphoreTake(xMutex, portMAX_DELAY);
```

- **Event Groups**: These are useful when tasks need to wait for multiple conditions to be met before proceeding. An event group is essentially a set of bits, each representing a different event.

```c++
xEventGroupWaitBits(xEventGroup, BIT_0 | BIT_1, pdTRUE, pdFALSE, portMAX_DELAY);
```

#### Memory Management

FreeRTOS provides flexible memory management schemes tailored to different application needs:

1. **Heap_1**: A very basic scheme where memory is allocated statically, and there is no way to free allocated memory. This is useful for highly deterministic systems where memory usage is known a priori.

2. **Heap_2**: Adds the ability to free memory, introducing a free list scheme. However, it is limited by potential fragmentation.

3. **Heap_3**: Simply wrappers around the standard C library `malloc` and `free` functions, providing the greatest flexibility at the cost of potential non-deterministic behavior.

4. **Heap_4**: An advanced scheme that builds on Heap_2 by using a more sophisticated scheme to minimize fragmentation. It provides a good balance between flexibility and efficiency.

5. **Heap_5**: The most advanced memory management scheme, combining features of the previous schemes and adding the ability to create multiple memory regions, providing almost full control over how and where memory is allocated and freed.

#### Tick Timer

The tick timer is a periodic interrupt source that drives the FreeRTOS kernel. It keeps track of time and is responsible for time-slicing and delaying tasks. The tick rate is defined by the `configTICK_RATE_HZ` configuration parameter, typically set between 1 Hz and 1000 Hz, although this should be chosen carefully based on application needs.

The tick interrupt handler updates the tick count, manages the time-delay list, and performs scheduling if needed. The tick count can be used for time-stamping and delay calculations:

```c++
vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(100)); // Delays the task for 100 milliseconds
```

#### Configurability

FreeRTOS is highly configurable through the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` header file. This file allows developers to enable or disable features, set task priorities, define memory management scheme, and customize tick rate among other settings. Such configurability ensures FreeRTOS can be tailored to the specific requirements of a given application.

#### Portability

Portability is a key strength of FreeRTOS. It can be easily adapted to new processors and architectures by writing a small amount of porting code typically encapsulated in just three files:

1. **port.c**: Implements functions for context switch, start the first task, and handling tick interrupts.
2. **portmacro.h**: Defines macros that map FreeRTOS kernel calls to architecture-specific instructions.
3. **portasm.s (or .S)**: Contains assembly routines for context switching (if required).

FreeRTOS officially supports over 35 architectures including ARM Cortex-M, AVR, MSP430, PIC32, and more, showcasing its versatility.

#### Summary

FreeRTOS's architecture is designed to be lightweight yet powerful, offering a wide range of features necessary for building real-time applications. From its efficient scheduler and versatile tasks to robust inter-task communication mechanisms and flexible memory management, FreeRTOS stands out as a reliable and adaptable real-time operating system. Its high configurability and portability further solidify its position as a preferred choice for embedded system developers. Understanding its core components and mechanisms is essential for leveraging its full potential in developing real-time applications.

        - `FreeRTOS.h`
        - `list.c`
        - `queue.c`
        - `tasks.c`
        - `timers.c`
        - `port.c` and `portmacro.h` specific to your architecture.
    - Ensure these files are included in your project build paths.

3. **Including FreeRTOS Configuration File**:
    - Create a `FreeRTOSConfig.h` file in your project directory. This file will define various configuration parameters required by FreeRTOS.
    ```c++
    #ifndef FREERTOS_CONFIG_H
    #define FREERTOS_CONFIG_H

    #define configUSE_PREEMPTION             1
    #define configUSE_IDLE_HOOK              0
    #define configUSE_TICK_HOOK              0
    #define configCPU_CLOCK_HZ               ( ( unsigned long ) 8000000 )
    #define configTICK_RATE_HZ               ( ( TickType_t ) 1000 )
    #define configMAX_PRIORITIES             ( 5 )
    #define configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE         ( ( unsigned short ) 130 )

    #define INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend             1
    #define INCLUDE_vTaskDelayUntil          1
    #define INCLUDE_vTaskDelay               1

    #endif /* FREERTOS_CONFIG_H */
    ```
 
    Adjust the configuration parameters based on your application's requirements.

#### Configuring the System Tick Timer

The system tick timer is crucial for FreeRTOS’s time management functions. It generates periodic interrupts that keep track of time and configure task switching. Configuring the tick timer typically involves:

1. **Selecting a Timer**:
    - Choose a hardware timer available on your microcontroller to generate the system tick.

2. **Configuring the Timer**:
    - Configure the timer to generate interrupts at the desired rate (e.g., 1 ms if `configTICK_RATE_HZ` is set to 1000).

3. **Implementing the Tick Handler**:
    - Write the ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) to handle the tick interrupt and call the FreeRTOS tick function.

Example ISR for ARM Cortex-M using SysTick:

```c++
void SysTick_Handler(void) {
    HAL_IncTick();
    if (xTaskGetSchedulerState() != taskSCHEDULER_NOT_STARTED) {
        xPortSysTickHandler();
    }
}
```

#### Creating Tasks

In FreeRTOS, tasks are the fundamental unit of execution. Creating tasks involves defining task functions and using the necessary FreeRTOS APIs to create and manage these tasks.

1. **Defining Task Functions**:
    - Each task is defined by a function taking a single parameter of type `void*`.

    ```c++
    void vTaskFunction(void *pvParameters) {
        for (;;) {
            // Task code goes here
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Creating Tasks**:
    - Use the `xTaskCreate` function to create tasks.
    - Store the task handle for future reference.
    ```c++
    TaskHandle_t xTaskHandle = NULL;
    xTaskCreate(vTaskFunction, "TaskName", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE_PRIORITY, &xTaskHandle);
    ```
  
3. **Starting the Scheduler**:
    - Once tasks are created, start the FreeRTOS scheduler using `vTaskStartScheduler`.
    ```c++
    void main(void) {
        // System and peripherals initialization

        // Create tasks
        xTaskCreate(vTaskFunction, "Task1", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, 1, NULL);

        // Start the scheduler
        vTaskStartScheduler();

        // Should never reach here as control is taken by FreeRTOS
        for (;;);
    }
    ```

#### Inter-task Communication

FreeRTOS provides several mechanisms for safe and effective inter-task communication, such as queues, semaphores, and direct task notifications.

1. **Queues**:
    - Queues are used to send and receive data between tasks.
    - Create a queue using `xQueueCreate`.
    - Send data using `xQueueSend` and receive using `xQueueReceive`.

    ```c++
    QueueHandle_t xQueue;
    xQueue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(int));

    // Sending data
    int dataToSend = 42;
    xQueueSend(xQueue, &dataToSend, portMAX_DELAY);

    // Receiving data
    int receivedData;
    xQueueReceive(xQueue, &receivedData, portMAX_DELAY);
    ```

2. **Semaphores**:
    - Semaphores are used for synchronization and managing shared resources.
    - Create binary or counting semaphores using `xSemaphoreCreateBinary` or `xSemaphoreCreateCounting`.
    
    ```c++
    SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateBinary();
    
    // Take semaphore
    xSemaphoreTake(xSemaphore, portMAX_DELAY);
    
    // Give semaphore
    xSemaphoreGive(xSemaphore);
    ```

3. **Mutexes**:
    - Mutexes are used for mutual exclusion to prevent concurrent access to a resource.
    ```c++
    SemaphoreHandle_t xMutex = xSemaphoreCreateMutex();

    // Take mutex
    xSemaphoreTake(xMutex, portMAX_DELAY);

    // Critical section

    // Give mutex
    xSemaphoreGive(xMutex);
    ```

4. **Event Groups**:
    - Event groups are used for signaling multiple events to tasks.
    ```c++
    EventGroupHandle_t xEventGroup = xEventGroupCreate();

    // Set event bits
    xEventGroupSetBits(xEventGroup, BIT_0);

    // Wait for event bits
    xEventGroupWaitBits(xEventGroup, BIT_0, pdTRUE, pdFALSE, portMAX_DELAY);
    ```

#### Timers and Delays

Timers in FreeRTOS allow functions to be executed at specific intervals. These can be one-shot or periodic.

1. **Creating a Timer**:
    - Use `xTimerCreate` to create a software timer.
    ```c++
    TimerHandle_t xTimer = xTimerCreate("Timer", pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000), pdTRUE, (void*)0, TimerCallbackFunction);
    ```

2. **Starting a Timer**:
    - Start the timer using `xTimerStart`.
    ```c++
    BaseType_t xResult;
    xResult = xTimerStart(xTimer, portMAX_DELAY);
    ```

3. **Using Delays**:
    - Use `vTaskDelay` to delay a task for a specified duration.
    ```c++
    vTaskDelay(pdMSTO_TICKS(100)); // Delay task for 100 ms
    ```

#### Debugging and Diagnostics

Effective debugging and diagnostics are essential for developing robust FreeRTOS applications.

1. **Using a Debugger**:
    - Utilize the debugger in your IDE to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code.

2. **FreeRTOS Trace Facility**:
    - FreeRTOS supports trace hooks that can be enabled for diagnostic purposes.
    - Implement trace macros in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`.

    ```c++
    #define traceTASK_SWITCHED_IN() \
        { if (pxCurrentTCB->pcTaskName) printf("Task %s is running\n", pxCurrentTCB->pcTaskName); }
    ```

3. **Monitoring Task States**:
    - Use FreeRTOS API such as `uxTaskGetSystemState` to obtain task state information.

    ```c++
    void vTaskGetSystemState(TaskStatus_t *pxTaskStatusArray, UBaseType_t uxArraySize, uint32_t *pulTotalRunTime);
    ```

4. **Stack Overflow Detection**:
    - Enable stack overflow detection in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`.
    ```c++
    #define configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW  2

    void vApplicationStackOverflowHook(TaskHandle_t xTask, char *pcTaskName) {
        printf("Stack overflow in task %s\n", pcTaskName);
        taskDISABLE_INTERRUPTS();
        for (;;);
    }
    ```

#### Summary

Getting started with FreeRTOS involves setting up an appropriate development environment, acquiring the FreeRTOS source code, creating and configuring a new FreeRTOS project, and understanding fundamental concepts such as task creation, inter-task communication, and system tick configuration. This detailed guide ensures you can confidently navigate these initial steps, laying a solid foundation for developing robust and efficient real-time applications using FreeRTOS. Mastery of these foundational steps will set you up for success in leveraging advanced FreeRTOS features and optimizing your real-time application.

### Advanced FreeRTOS Techniques

Having established a solid foundation with the basics of FreeRTOS, this section will delve into advanced techniques aimed at optimizing and extending the capabilities of your FreeRTOS-based applications. Topics such as advanced task management, optimizing memory usage, power management, integrating FreeRTOS with other middleware, and advanced debugging will be covered in scientific detail, ensuring you can extract the maximum efficiency and functionality from your real-time operating system.

#### Advanced Task Management

Managing tasks effectively is crucial for building scalable and efficient FreeRTOS applications. Advanced task management encompasses dynamic task control, priority management, and task aware debugging.

##### Dynamic Task Creation and Deletion

In some applications, it is necessary to create and delete tasks dynamically during runtime. FreeRTOS provides APIs for task creation (`xTaskCreate`) and deletion (`vTaskDelete`), but care must be taken to manage system resources efficiently.

- **Dynamic Creation**: 
  Dynamic task creation allows the system to allocate resources as needed, improving flexibility and resource utilization. It is essential to monitor heap usage to avoid fragmentation and resource exhaustion.

- **Dynamic Deletion**:
  Deleting tasks frees resources and prevents memory leaks. It is crucial to ensure that any resources allocated by the task (e.g., semaphores, queues) are also freed.

  ```c++
  void vDynamicTaskCreation(void) {
      TaskHandle_t xHandle = NULL;

      // Creating a task
      xTaskCreate(vTaskFunction, "DynamicTask", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE_PRIORITY, &xHandle);

      // Deleting the task after completion
      vTaskDelete(xHandle);
  }
  ```

##### Priority Management

Priority management is vital for maintaining real-time performance. FreeRTOS supports up to 256 priority levels, defined by the `configMAX_PRIORITIES` parameter in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`. Understanding priority inversion and priority inheritance mechanisms is essential for effective priority management.

- **Priority Inversion**:
  Occurs when a high-priority task is waiting for a resource held by a lower-priority task, while a medium-priority task preempts the lower-priority task. This can be mitigated using mutexes with priority inheritance.

  ```c++
  xMutex = xSemaphoreCreateMutex();
  xSemaphoreTake(xMutex, portMAX_DELAY);
  // Critical section
  xSemaphoreGive(xMutex);
  ```

- **Priority Inheritance**:
  Ensures that a lower-priority task that holds a resource required by a higher-priority task assumes a temporary priority level equal to that of the higher-priority task. This reduces the risk of priority inversion and ensures timely task completion.

##### Task Notification Mechanisms

FreeRTOS’s task notification mechanism provides a lightweight and efficient alternative to queues and semaphores for signaling events between tasks. Each task has an array of notification values that can be used for sending notifications from interrupts or other tasks.

```c++
void vSenderTask(void *pvParameters) {
    // Notify a receiver task
    xTaskNotify(xReceiverTaskHandle, 0x01, eSetBits);
}

void vReceiverTask(void *pvParameters) {
    uint32_t ulNotificationValue;

    // Block until notification with value 0x01 is received
    xTaskNotifyWait(0x00, 0xFFFFFFFF, &ulNotificationValue, portMAX_DELAY);

    if (ulNotificationValue & 0x01) {
        // Process the notification
    }
}
```

#### Optimizing Memory Usage

Efficient memory management is critical in embedded systems with limited resources. FreeRTOS provides several mechanisms to optimize memory usage, including custom memory allocators, static task allocation, and heap management techniques.

##### Custom Memory Allocators

FreeRTOS allows developers to implement custom memory allocation schemes to better control memory usage. By defining the `pvPortMalloc` and `vPortFree` functions, developers can replace the default heap management schemes (`heap_1` to `heap_5`) with custom allocation strategies.

```c++
void* pvPortMalloc(size_t xSize) {
    // Custom allocation logic
}

void vPortFree(void* pv) {
    // Custom deallocation logic
}
```

##### Static Task Allocation

Static allocation of tasks and other FreeRTOS objects (queues, semaphores) ensures predictable memory usage and reduces the likelihood of fragmentation. FreeRTOS provides APIs for static allocation, which require pre-allocated memory from the application.

```c++
StaticTask_t xTaskBuffer;
StackType_t xStack[STACK_SIZE];

TaskHandle_t xTaskHandle = xTaskCreateStatic(vTaskCode, "TaskName", STACK_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE_PRIORITY, xStack, &xTaskBuffer);
```

##### Heap Management Techniques

Choosing the appropriate heap management scheme (`heap_1` to `heap_5`) based on application requirements is crucial. For complex applications, `heap_4` or `heap_5` may be preferable due to their advanced allocation and fragmentation handling capabilities.

- **Heap_1**: Simplest but does not support memory freeing.
- **Heap_2**: Supports memory freeing but can be susceptible to fragmentation.
- **Heap_4**: Implements a best-fit algorithm to minimize fragmentation.

Example configuration for `heap_4` in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`:

```c++
#define configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE ( ( size_t ) ( 10 * 1024 ) )
```

#### Advanced Power Management

Power management is a key concern in many embedded systems, particularly in battery-powered and low-power IoT devices. FreeRTOS supports several techniques to optimize power consumption, including idle task management, tickless idle mode, and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS).

##### Idle Task Management

The idle task runs when no other task is ready to execute and can be customized to perform low-priority housekeeping functions or put the CPU into low-power modes.

- **Idle Hook**: A user-defined function that runs within the context of the idle task.

  ```c++
  void vApplicationIdleHook(void) {
      // Enter low-power mode
      __WFI(); // Wait For Interrupt
  }
  ```

##### Tickless Idle Mode

Tickless idle mode suppresses the periodic tick interrupt when no tasks are ready to run, allowing the CPU to remain in low-power mode for extended periods. This reduces power consumption significantly.

- **Configuration**: Enable tickless mode in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`.
  ```c++
  #define configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE 1
  ```

- **Implementation**: Implement the `vPortSuppressTicksAndSleep` function to configure the system's low-power mode and manage the tick counter.

##### Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)

DVFS adjusts the processor's operating voltage and frequency based on the current workload, reducing power consumption when the workload is low.

- **Implementation**: Integrate DVFS control into the idle hook or system tick handler to dynamically adjust the voltage and frequency.

#### Integrating FreeRTOS with Middleware

Modern embedded systems often require integration with middleware such as networking stacks, file systems, and security frameworks. FreeRTOS provides several integration points for such middleware.

##### Networking Stacks

Integrating a TCP/IP stack with FreeRTOS enables networked applications. Popular networking stacks compatible with FreeRTOS include lwIP, FreeRTOS+TCP, and mbedTLS.

- **lwIP Integration**:
  ```c++
  void initNetworkStack(void) {
      // Initialize lwIP stack
      lwip_init();
      // Configure network interface
      struct netif netif;
      netif_add(&netif, &ipaddr, &netmask, &gw, NULL, ethernetif_init, ethernet_input);
      netif_set_default(&netif);
      netif_set_up(&netif);
  }
  ```

- **FreeRTOS+TCP Integration**:
  ```c++
  void initFreeRTOSPlusTCP(void) {
      // Initialize FreeRTOS+TCP stack
      FreeRTOS_IPInit(ipAddress, netMask, gatewayAddress, dnsServerAddress, macAddress);
  }
  ```

##### File Systems

Integrating a file system with FreeRTOS enables storage management. Common file systems used include FAT, LittleFS, and SPIFFS.

- **FAT File System Integration**:
  ```c++
  void initFileSystem(void) {
      FATFS fs;
      f_mount(&fs, "", 1);
  }
  ```

- **LittleFS Integration**:
  ```c++
  void initLittleFS(void) {
      lfs_mount(&lfs, &config);
  }
  ```

##### Security Frameworks

Integrating a security framework ensures secure data transmission and storage. Popular frameworks include mbedTLS and FreeRTOS+TLS.

- **mbedTLS Integration**:
  ```c++
  void initTLS(void) {
      mbedtls_ssl_context ssl;
      mbedtls_ssl_init(&ssl);
      // Configure and establish SSL connection
  }
  ```

#### Advanced Debugging Techniques

Advanced debugging techniques are essential for identifying and resolving complex issues in FreeRTOS applications.

##### FreeRTOS Trace Debugging

Trace debugging involves recording and analyzing system events to understand system behavior. Tools like FreeRTOS+Trace provide comprehensive trace recording and visualization.

- **Configuration**: Enable trace hooks in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`.
  ```c++
  #define configUSE_TRACE_FACILITY 1
  ```

- **Trace Library Integration**: Use FreeRTOS+Trace API to configure trace recording.
  ```c++
  uiTraceStart();
  ```

##### Using JTAG and SWD Debuggers

JTAG and SWD debuggers provide low-level access to the target system, enabling in-depth analysis of system state and behavior. Set breakpoints, watch variables, and step through code using your IDE’s debugging tools.

##### Monitoring System Metrics

Monitoring system metrics such as CPU usage, task execution time, and memory usage is crucial for diagnosing performance issues.

- **CPU Usage**: Use FreeRTOS API to get task run-time statistics.
  ```c++
  void vTaskGetRunTimeStats(char *pcWriteBuffer) {
      // Retrieve and print task run-time statistics
  }
  ```

- **Memory Usage**: Monitor heap usage using FreeRTOS API.
  ```c++
  size_t xFreeHeapSpace = xPortGetFreeHeapSize();
  ```

#### Summary

Advanced FreeRTOS techniques encompass a wide range of topics aimed at maximizing the efficiency, functionality, and reliability of real-time applications. From dynamic task management and priority handling to optimizing memory and power usage, integrating with middleware, and employing advanced debugging methods, these techniques provide developers with the tools and knowledge needed to fully leverage FreeRTOS's capabilities. By mastering these advanced topics, developers can ensure their FreeRTOS applications meet stringent real-time requirements while maintaining high performance and resource efficiency.
