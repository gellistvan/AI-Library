#include <rtems.h>
#include <iostream>

// Define the entry point for the task
rtems_task TaskEntry(rtems_task_argument argument) {
    std::cout << "Task is running with argument: " << argument << std::endl;
    
    // Example: Task performs a simple delay
    rtems_task_wake_after(RTEMS_MILLISECONDS_TO_TICKS(1000));
    
    std::cout << "Task completed." << std::endl;
    rtems_task_delete(RTEMS_SELF);  // Delete the task after completion
}

// Define the configuration (simplified for brevity)
#define CONFIGURE_INIT

#include <rtems/confdefs.h>

extern "C" void Init(rtems_task_argument argument) {
    // Create a new task
    rtems_id task_id;
    rtems_name task_name = rtems_build_name('T', 'A', 'S', 'K');
    rtems_task_create(task_name, 1, RTEMS_MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE,
                      RTEMS_DEFAULT_MODES, RTEMS_DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTES, &task_id);
    
    // Start the task
    rtems_task_start(task_id, TaskEntry, 42); // Pass an argument to the task
    
    // The Init task typically does not delete itself and continues to run or terminates RTEMS.
    std::cout << "Init task completed." << std::endl;
    
    // Optionally, terminate RTEMS
    rtems_shutdown_executive(0);
}
```

In this example, the `TaskEntry` function serves as the entry point for a new task created in the `Init` task. The `Init` task initializes the environment, creates a new task, and starts it with a designated argument. The C++ API in RTEMS leverages classes and objects to encapsulate RTOS services, providing a familiar environment for C++ developers.
