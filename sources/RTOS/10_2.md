To ensure comprehension of these advanced topics, let's consider a simple C++ example that illustrates basic real-time scheduling concepts. This example demonstrates the use of a priority-based scheduling approach, which is foundational to many RTOS implementations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>
#include <functional>

using namespace std;
using namespace std::chrono;

struct Task {
    int priority;
    int executionTime; // in milliseconds
    std::function<void()> taskFunction;
    system_clock::time_point startTime;

    // Define a comparator for the priority queue
    bool operator>(const Task& other) const {
        return priority > other.priority;
    }
};

priority_queue<Task, vector<Task>, greater<>> taskQueue;

void addTask(int priority, int executionTime, std::function<void()> func) {
    Task newTask;
    newTask.priority = priority;
    newTask.executionTime = executionTime;
    newTask.taskFunction = func;
    newTask.startTime = system_clock::now();
    taskQueue.push(newTask);
}

void scheduler() {
    while (!taskQueue.empty()) {
        Task currentTask = taskQueue.top();
        taskQueue.pop();
        cout << "Executing task with priority: " << currentTask.priority << endl;
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(milliseconds(currentTask.executionTime));
        currentTask.taskFunction();
        cout << "Task with priority " << currentTask.priority << " completed." << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Add tasks to the scheduler
    addTask(1, 500, [](){
        cout << "Task 1 running\n";
    });
    addTask(2, 300, [](){
        cout << "Task 2 running\n";
    });
    addTask(1, 200, [](){
        cout << "Task 3 running\n";
    });

    scheduler();

    return 0;
}
```

In this simple example, tasks are added to a priority queue based on their priorities. The scheduler then executes the tasks in order of priority, simulating a basic real-time scheduling system. While this example is rudimentary, it serves to illustrate the principles discussed in the aforementioned literature.
