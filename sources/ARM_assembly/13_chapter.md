## 13. **System Programming**

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of system programming, where software interacts closely with hardware to perform essential tasks. We start with **Bootloader Development**, guiding you through writing a simple ARM bootloader, the initial piece of code that runs when a device is powered on. Next, we explore **Operating System Fundamentals**, introducing the basics of OS development in assembly language, highlighting the core components and operations. We then move on to **Low-Level Device Drivers**, where you'll learn to create drivers that facilitate communication between the operating system and hardware devices. To cement your understanding, we conclude with **A Combined Example with Explanation**, integrating all these concepts into a cohesive, practical application. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive foundation in system programming, equipping you with the skills to develop low-level software that directly controls hardware operations.

### Writing a Simple ARM Bootloader

Bootloaders are critical components in embedded systems and computing devices, acting as the first piece of code that runs when a device is powered on or reset. They initialize the hardware and load the operating system (OS) or firmware into memory. This chapter will provide a comprehensive, detailed guide to developing a simple ARM bootloader, covering theoretical concepts, practical steps, and best practices.

#### 1. Introduction to Bootloaders

Bootloaders serve several essential functions:
- **Initialize Hardware**: Set up the processor, memory, and peripherals.
- **Load and Execute the Kernel**: Load the operating system kernel or another program into RAM and execute it.
- **Provide a Recovery Mechanism**: Allow users to recover or update the firmware in case of failure.

Understanding bootloaders involves knowing the hardware architecture, memory layout, and the specific requirements of the target system.

#### 2. ARM Architecture Overview

The ARM architecture is widely used in embedded systems due to its efficiency and performance. ARM processors come in various versions, with ARM Cortex-M, Cortex-R, and Cortex-A being common in different applications. This section provides a brief overview of ARM architecture relevant to bootloader development.

##### 2.1 ARM Processor Modes

ARM processors operate in several modes:
- **User Mode**: Regular execution mode for user applications.
- **FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request) Mode**: Handles fast interrupts.
- **IRQ (Interrupt Request) Mode**: Handles standard interrupts.
- **Supervisor Mode**: Privileged mode for OS kernel.
- **Abort Mode**: Handles memory access violations.
- **Undefined Mode**: Handles undefined instructions.
- **System Mode**: Privileged mode similar to User mode.

Understanding these modes is crucial for handling exceptions and interrupts in the bootloader.

##### 2.2 ARM Memory Model

ARM processors use a flat memory model with a unified address space. Key memory regions include:
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**: Stores the bootloader code.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Used for runtime data and stack.
- **Peripheral Memory**: Memory-mapped I/O for peripherals.

The bootloader must correctly configure the memory map and manage memory protection units (MPUs) if present.

#### 3. Bootloader Design and Requirements

##### 3.1 Design Considerations

When designing a bootloader, consider the following:
- **Minimalistic and Efficient**: Bootloaders should be small and efficient, minimizing the time from power-on to OS startup.
- **Robust and Reliable**: They must handle failures gracefully and provide recovery options.
- **Hardware Initialization**: Properly initialize clocks, memory, and peripherals.
- **Security**: Implement secure boot mechanisms to prevent unauthorized code execution.

##### 3.2 Requirements

A typical ARM bootloader performs the following tasks:
1. **Processor Initialization**: Set up the CPU, including mode settings and vector table.
2. **Memory Initialization**: Configure RAM, cache, and memory protection.
3. **Peripheral Initialization**: Initialize essential peripherals (e.g., UART for debug output).
4. **Load Kernel**: Load the OS kernel or application code from non-volatile storage to RAM.
5. **Jump to Kernel**: Transfer control to the loaded code.

#### 4. Bootloader Development Steps

##### 4.1 Development Environment

Set up a development environment with the following tools:
- **Cross-Compiler**: ARM GCC toolchain for compiling ARM code.
- **Debugger**: GDB or other ARM-compatible debuggers.
- **Emulator/Simulator**: QEMU or hardware development board (e.g., Raspberry Pi, STM32).

##### 4.2 Assembly Language Basics

Bootloaders are often written in assembly language for precise control over hardware. Here are some basic ARM assembly instructions:
- **MOV**: Move data between registers.
- **LDR/STR**: Load/store data from/to memory.
- **B/BL**: Branch (jump) to a label, with BL saving the return address.
- **CMP**: Compare two values.
- **MRS/MSR**: Read/write special registers.

##### 4.3 Initializing the Stack

The stack is critical for function calls and interrupts. Initialize it by setting the stack pointer (SP):
```assembly
    LDR R0, =_stack_top   ; Load stack top address
    MOV SP, R0            ; Set SP to stack top
```
Define `_stack_top` in the linker script to point to the end of RAM.

##### 4.4 Configuring the Vector Table

The vector table contains addresses of exception and interrupt handlers. Typically located at address 0x00000000, it must be set up early:
```assembly
    LDR R0, =_vector_table
    LDR R1, =0x00000000
    STR R0, [R1]
```
The vector table includes entries for reset, undefined instructions, software interrupts (SWI), prefetch aborts, data aborts, and IRQ/FIQ.

##### 4.5 Clock and Power Management

Initialize the system clock and power settings:
```assembly
    ; Example for an STM32F4 microcontroller
    LDR R0, =RCC_BASE
    LDR R1, [R0, #RCC_CR]
    ORR R1, R1, #(1 << 16)  ; HSEON: High-Speed External clock enable
    STR R1, [R0, #RCC_CR]
    ; Wait for HSE to be ready
wait_hse_ready:
    LDR R1, [R0, #RCC_CR]
    TST R1, #(1 << 17)      ; HSERDY: HSE ready flag
    BEQ wait_hse_ready
    ; Configure PLL and set clock source
```

##### 4.6 UART Initialization for Debugging

Enable UART for debug output:
```assembly
    ; Example for a generic UART initialization
    LDR R0, =UART_BASE
    ; Set baud rate, data bits, parity, etc.
    LDR R1, =0x00000000
    STR R1, [R0, #UART_BAUD]
    ; Enable UART
    LDR R1, [R0, #UART_CR]
    ORR R1, R1, #(1 << 0)   ; UARTEN: UART enable
    STR R1, [R0, #UART_CR]
```
Use UART to print debug messages:
```assembly
uart_putc:
    LDR R1, =UART_BASE
    ; Wait for transmit FIFO to be empty
wait_fifo:
    LDR R2, [R1, #UART_FR]
    TST R2, #(1 << 5)       ; TXFF: Transmit FIFO full
    BNE wait_fifo
    ; Write character to data register
    STR R0, [R1, #UART_DR]
    BX LR
```

##### 4.7 Loading the Kernel

Load the kernel from non-volatile storage (e.g., Flash, SD card) to RAM:
```assembly
load_kernel:
    ; Assuming kernel image is at a fixed location in Flash
    LDR R0, =KERNEL_FLASH_BASE
    LDR R1, =KERNEL_RAM_BASE
    LDR R2, =KERNEL_SIZE
copy_kernel:
    LDRB R3, [R0], #1
    STRB R3, [R1], #1
    SUBS R2, R2, #1
    BNE copy_kernel
```

##### 4.8 Jumping to the Kernel

Transfer control to the loaded kernel:
```assembly
    LDR R0, =KERNEL_RAM_BASE
    BX R0
```
Ensure the kernel entry point is correctly set in the linker script.

#### 5. Memory Management and MPU Configuration

Memory Protection Units (MPUs) enhance security and stability by controlling access permissions for memory regions. Configure the MPU if present:
```assembly
configure_mpu:
    ; Example configuration
    LDR R0, =MPU_BASE
    ; Disable MPU
    STR R1, [R0, #MPU_CTRL]
    ; Configure regions (e.g., Flash, RAM, peripherals)
    ; Enable MPU
    STR R1, [R0, #MPU_CTRL]
```

#### 6. Interrupt Handling

Set up basic interrupt handling to manage external events:
```assembly
interrupt_handler:
    ; Save context
    ; Identify interrupt source
    ; Handle interrupt
    ; Restore context
    SUB LR, LR, #4
    STMFD SP!, {R0-R12, LR}
    MRS R0, SPSR
    STMFD SP!, {R0}
    ; Read interrupt source and handle
    LDMFD SP!, {R0}
    MSR SPSR_cxsf, R0
    LDMFD SP!, {R0-R12, PC}^
```

#### 7. Error Handling and Recovery

Implement robust error handling to manage failures gracefully:
```assembly
error_handler:
    ; Log error
    ; Attempt recovery or enter safe state
    B .
```

#### 8. Secure Boot Implementation

Ensure secure boot to verify the integrity and authenticity of the firmware:
```assembly
secure_boot:
    ; Compute hash of the firmware
    ; Compare with stored hash
    ; Verify signature if applicable
    ; Abort if verification fails
    ; Proceed to load and execute kernel
```

#### 9. Putting It All Together: Complete Example

Here is a complete, simplified example of an ARM bootloader:

```assembly
.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    ; Initialize stack
    LDR R0, =_stack_top
    MOV SP, R0

    ; Initialize vector table

```

### Basics of OS Development in Assembly

Developing an operating system (OS) from scratch is one of the most challenging and rewarding tasks in the field of computer science. This chapter will guide you through the fundamentals of OS development using assembly language, focusing on the ARM architecture. We will cover the essential components and concepts, including system initialization, task scheduling, memory management, interrupt handling, and basic I/O operations. This comprehensive guide aims to provide you with the foundational knowledge required to develop a simple yet functional OS.

#### 1. Introduction to Operating Systems

An operating system is a software layer that manages hardware resources and provides services to application programs. The main functions of an OS include:
- **Process Management**: Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes.
- **Memory Management**: Allocating and deallocating memory spaces.
- **File System Management**: Managing files and directories on storage devices.
- **Device Management**: Controlling and communicating with hardware devices.
- **Security and Access Control**: Protecting data and resources from unauthorized access.

#### 2. System Initialization

System initialization is the first step in OS development. It involves setting up the CPU, memory, and essential hardware components to prepare the system for running user applications.

##### 2.1 Bootloader

The bootloader, discussed in the previous chapter, loads the OS kernel into memory and transfers control to it. The bootloader must set up the initial stack and ensure that the system is in a known state.

##### 2.2 Kernel Entry Point

The kernel entry point is the first function executed by the kernel. It typically performs basic hardware initialization and sets up the kernel environment.
```assembly
.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    ; Initialize stack
    LDR R0, =_stack_top
    MOV SP, R0

    ; Initialize hardware
    BL init_hardware

    ; Call main kernel function
    BL kernel_main

    ; Halt the CPU
halt:
    B halt

init_hardware:
    ; Hardware initialization code goes here
    BX LR

_stack_top = 0x20002000
```

#### 3. Memory Management

Memory management is a crucial aspect of OS development. It involves managing the allocation, deallocation, and protection of memory spaces used by the OS and applications.

##### 3.1 Memory Layout

Define a memory layout for the OS, including regions for the kernel, user applications, and peripheral devices.
```assembly
MEMORY
{
    ROM (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 256K
    RAM (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 64K
}

SECTIONS
{
    .text : { *(.text*) } > ROM
    .data : { *(.data*) } > RAM
    .bss  : { *(.bss*)  } > RAM
    .stack : { . = ALIGN(8); *(.stack) } > RAM
}
```

##### 3.2 Paging and Segmentation

Implement paging and segmentation to manage memory efficiently and provide isolation between processes.

**Paging**:
Paging divides memory into fixed-size blocks called pages. The OS maintains a page table to map virtual addresses to physical addresses.
```assembly
setup_paging:
    ; Set up page table
    LDR R0, =page_table
    ; Initialize page table entries
    ; Enable paging in the CPU
    BX LR

page_table:
    .space 4096  ; Example page table with 1024 entries
```

**Segmentation**:
Segmentation divides memory into variable-sized segments, each with a base address and limit. The OS uses segment descriptors to manage segments.
```assembly
setup_segmentation:
    ; Set up segment descriptors
    LDR R0, =gdt
    ; Load GDT register
    LDR R1, =gdtr
    STR R0, [R1]
    ; Enable segmentation in the CPU
    BX LR

gdt:
    .space 32  ; Example GDT with 4 entries

gdtr:
    .word gdt
    .word (gdt_end - gdt - 1)

gdt_end:
```

#### 4. Process Management

Process management involves creating, scheduling, and terminating processes. A process is an instance of a running program, including its code, data, and execution context.

##### 4.1 Process Control Block (PCB)

The PCB is a data structure that stores information about a process, such as its state, program counter, registers, and memory allocation.
```assembly
PCB:
    .word process_id
    .word process_state
    .word program_counter
    .word registers[16]
    .word stack_pointer
    .word base_pointer
    .word memory_base
    .word memory_limit
```

##### 4.2 Context Switching

Context switching involves saving the state of the current process and restoring the state of the next process to be executed.
```assembly
save_context:
    ; Save current process state to PCB
    STR R0, [PCB, #program_counter]
    ; Save registers
    STMIA PCB, {R1-R12, LR}
    ; Save stack pointer
    STR SP, [PCB, #stack_pointer]
    BX LR

restore_context:
    ; Restore process state from PCB
    LDR R0, [PCB, #program_counter]
    ; Restore registers
    LDMIA PCB, {R1-R12, LR}
    ; Restore stack pointer
    LDR SP, [PCB, #stack_pointer]
    BX LR
```

##### 4.3 Process Scheduling

Process scheduling determines the order in which processes are executed. Implement a simple round-robin scheduler.
```assembly
scheduler:
    ; Select next process
    LDR R0, =current_process
    ADD R0, R0, #1
    CMP R0, =num_processes
    BEQ reset_process
    ; Restore context of next process
    BL restore_context
    BX LR

reset_process:
    MOV R0, #0
    BL restore_context
    BX LR

current_process:
    .word 0

num_processes:
    .word 4
```

#### 5. Interrupt Handling

Interrupts are signals that temporarily halt the CPU's current execution to handle external or internal events. Proper interrupt handling is essential for responsive systems.

##### 5.1 Interrupt Vector Table

Set up the interrupt vector table with addresses of interrupt service routines (ISRs).
```assembly
_vector_table:
    .word _start                ; Reset
    .word undefined_handler
    .word swi_handler
    .word prefetch_abort_handler
    .word data_abort_handler
    .word 0                     ; Reserved
    .word irq_handler
    .word fiq_handler
```

##### 5.2 Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)

An ISR handles the specific interrupt and performs necessary actions before returning control to the interrupted process.
```assembly
irq_handler:
    ; Save context
    SUB LR, LR, #4
    STMFD SP!, {R0-R12, LR}
    MRS R0, SPSR
    STMFD SP!, {R0}

    ; Handle interrupt
    BL handle_irq

    ; Restore context
    LDMFD SP!, {R0}
    MSR SPSR_cxsf, R0
    LDMFD SP!, {R0-R12, PC}^
    BX LR

handle_irq:
    ; Identify interrupt source and handle it
    ; Acknowledge interrupt
    ; Example: Timer interrupt
    LDR R0, =TIMER_BASE
    LDR R1, [R0, #TIMER_IRQ]
    ; Clear interrupt flag
    BX LR
```

    wait_data:
        LDR R2, [R1, #UART_FR]
        TST R2, #(1 << 4)  ; RXFE: Receive FIFO empty
        BEQ wait_data
    LDR R0, [R1, #UART_DR]
    BX LR
```

##### 6.2 GPIO for General-Purpose I/O

Initialize GPIO and implement basic read/write functions for digital I/O pins.
```assembly
gpio_init:
    ; Initialize GPIO pins
    LDR R0, =GPIO_BASE

    ; Read value from GPIO pin
    LDR R1, =GPIO_BASE
    LDR R0, [R1, #GPIO_DATA]
    BX LR
```

#### 7. File System Management

A file system organizes and manages files on a storage device. Implement a simple file system to handle basic file operations.

##### 7.1 File System Initialization

Initialize the file system, including setting up storage and directory structures.

    ; Initialize file system structures
    LDR R0, =FS_BASE
    ; Create root directory
    LDR R1, =ROOT_DIR
    STR R1, [R0, #FS_ROOT]
    BX LR

FS_BASE:
    .space 1024  ; Example file system base

ROOT_DIR:
    .space 256   ; Example root directory
```

##### 7.2 File Operations

Implement basic file operations such as create, read, write, and delete.
```assembly

    BX LR
```

#### 8. Security and Access Control

Security and access control protect data and resources from unauthorized access and ensure system integrity.

##### 8.1 User Authentication

Implement basic user authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
```assembly
user_authenticate:
    ; Prompt for username and password
    ; Verify credentials against stored values
    ; Grant or deny access
    BX LR

### Low-Level Device Drivers

Device drivers are critical components of any operating system, acting as intermediaries between the hardware and the software. They enable the OS and applications to interact with hardware devices by providing a consistent interface, abstracting the underlying hardware complexity. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of creating low-level device drivers for ARM-based systems, focusing on the principles, techniques, and best practices needed for efficient and reliable driver development.

#### 1. Introduction to Device Drivers

Device drivers are specialized software modules that manage the communication between the operating system and hardware devices. Their primary responsibilities include:
- **Initialization**: Configuring the device upon system startup or when the device is connected.
- **Data Transfer**: Facilitating data exchange between the device and the system.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Responding to hardware interrupts generated by the device.
- **Resource Management**: Allocating and freeing hardware resources.

#### 2. Types of Device Drivers

Device drivers can be categorized based on the type of device they manage:
- **Character Device Drivers**: Manage devices that handle data as a stream of characters (e.g., keyboards, serial ports).
- **Block Device Drivers**: Manage devices that handle data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., hard drives, SSDs).
- **Network Device Drivers**: Manage network interfaces, facilitating data transfer over networks.
- **USB Device Drivers**: Manage USB devices, providing a flexible and scalable interface for a wide range of peripherals.

#### 3. Driver Development Environment

Setting up the development environment is crucial for driver development. The necessary tools include:
- **Cross-Compiler**: ARM GCC toolchain for compiling driver code.
- **Debugger**: GDB or another ARM-compatible debugger for testing and debugging drivers.
- **Emulator/Simulator**: QEMU or a hardware development board for testing drivers.

#### 4. Understanding Hardware Specifications

Before writing a driver, it's essential to understand the hardware specifications of the target device. This involves:
- **Datasheets and Manuals**: Detailed documents provided by the hardware manufacturer.
- **Register Maps**: Information about the memory-mapped registers used to control the device.
- **Communication Protocols**: Protocols used for data transfer between the device and the system (e.g., I2C, SPI, UART).

#### 5. Basic Structure of a Device Driver

A typical device driver consists of the following components:
- **Initialization Routine**: Configures the device and sets up necessary resources.
- **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**: Handles interrupts generated by the device.
- **Read/Write Functions**: Facilitate data transfer between the device and the system.
- **Cleanup Routine**: Releases resources and performs any necessary cleanup when the device is removed or the system shuts down.

#### 6. Writing a Simple Character Device Driver

Let's start with a simple character device driver for a UART serial port.

##### 6.1 UART Initialization

The initialization routine configures the UART registers to set the baud rate, data format, and enable the UART.
```assembly
.section .text
.global uart_init

uart_init:
    ; Assuming UART base address is 0x4000C000
    LDR R0, =0x4000C000

    ; Set baud rate (example: 115200)
    LDR R1, =115200
    STR R1, [R0, #UART_BAUD]

    ; Configure data format (8N1: 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit)
    LDR R1, =0x00000060
    STR R1, [R0, #UART_LCR]

    ; Enable UART
    LDR R1, [R0, #UART_CR]
    ORR R1, R1, #(1 << 0)   ; UARTEN: UART enable
    STR R1, [R0, #UART_CR]

    BX LR
```

##### 6.2 UART Read/Write Functions

Implement read and write functions to handle data transfer.
```assembly
.global uart_putc
.global uart_getc

uart_putc:
    ; Write character to UART
    LDR R1, =0x4000C000
    wait_fifo:
        LDR R2, [R1, #UART_FR]
        TST R2, #(1 << 5)  ; TXFF: Transmit FIFO full
        BNE wait_fifo
    STR R0, [R1, #UART_DR]
    BX LR

uart_getc:
    ; Read character from UART
    LDR R1, =0x4000C000
    wait_data:
        LDR R2, [R1, #UART_FR]
        TST R2, #(1 << 4)  ; RXFE: Receive FIFO empty
        BEQ wait_data
    LDR R0, [R1, #UART_DR]
    BX LR
```

#### 7. Writing a Block Device Driver

Block device drivers handle data in fixed-size blocks. Let's develop a simple driver for an SD card.

##### 7.1 SD Card Initialization

The initialization routine configures the SD card interface and prepares the card for data transfer.
```assembly
.section .text
.global sd_init

sd_init:
    ; Assuming SD card base address is 0x40004000
    LDR R0, =0x40004000

    ; Send initialization command (CMD0: GO_IDLE_STATE)
    LDR R1, =0x00000000
    STR R1, [R0, #SD_CMD]
    BL sd_wait_response

    ; Send card interface condition (CMD8)
    LDR R1, =0x000001AA
    STR R1, [R0, #SD_CMD]
    BL sd_wait_response

    ; Additional initialization commands...

    BX LR

sd_wait_response:
    ; Wait for response from SD card
    LDR R1, [R0, #SD_RESP]
    TST R1, #0x01  ; Check if card is still busy
    BNE sd_wait_response
    BX LR
```

##### 7.2 SD Card Read/Write Functions

Implement read and write functions to handle block data transfer.
```assembly

.global sd_write_block

sd_read_block:
    ; Read block of data from SD card
    LDR R1, =0x40004000

    ; Send read command (CMD17: READ_SINGLE_BLOCK)
    LDR R2, =0x00000011
    STR R2, [R1, #SD_CMD]
    BL sd_wait_response

    ; Read data block
    LDR R3, [R1, #SD_DATA]
    STR R3, [R0]
    ; Repeat for remaining block size...

    BX LR

sd_write_block:
    ; Write block of data to SD card
    LDR R1, =0x40004000

    ; Send write command (CMD24: WRITE_BLOCK)
    LDR R2, =0x00000018
    STR R2, [R1, #SD_CMD]
    BL sd_wait_response

    ; Write data block
    LDR R3, [R0]
    STR R3, [R1, #SD_DATA]
    ; Repeat for remaining block size...

    BX LR

    ; Enable interrupts for the device (example: UART interrupt)
    LDR R1, =0x00000001
    STR R1, [R0, #IRQ_ENABLE]

    BX LR
```

##### 8.2 Writing Interrupt Service Routines

    STMFD SP!, {R0-R12, LR}
    MRS R0, SPSR
    STMFD SP!, {R0}

    ; Handle UART interrupt
    LDR R1, =0x4000C000
    LDR R2, [R1, #UART_FR]
    TST R2, #(1 << 4)  ; RXFE: Receive FIFO empty
    BEQ handle_tx
    ; Read received data
    LDR R0, [R1, #UART_DR]
    ; Process received data...

handle_tx:
    TST R2, #(1 << 5)  ; TXFF: Transmit FIFO full
    BEQ irq_done
    ; Transmit data
    LDR R0, [R1, #UART_DR]
    ; Process transmitted data...

irq_done:
    ; Restore context
    LDMFD SP!, {R0}
    MSR SPSR_cxsf, R0
    LDMFD SP!, {R0-R12, PC}^
    BX LR
```
