**Assembler Directives**: Special instructions in the source code that control the assembly process, such as defining data, reserving storage space, and setting parameters.

**Assembly Language**: A low-level programming language that uses symbolic code and is specific to a computer architecture. It is closely related to machine code but is more readable for humans.

**Binary Code**: A coding system using the binary digits 0 and 1 to represent a letter, digit, or other character in a computer or other electronic device.

**Bootloader**: A small program that initializes the hardware and loads the main operating system or runtime environment for the computer.

**Branching**: The act of deviating from the sequential execution of instructions to another part of the program, usually based on a condition.

**Cache Memory**: A small, high-speed storage location that temporarily holds data and instructions that the processor is likely to reuse, speeding up processing.

**Conditional Execution**: The execution of instructions based on a condition being met. In ARM assembly, this often involves conditional instructions such as BEQ (branch if equal).

**Control Flow Instructions**: Instructions that alter the flow of execution in a program, such as jumps, branches, and loops.

**Cryptography**: The practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data against third parties. In assembly, this often involves implementing cryptographic algorithms.

**Data Processing Instructions**: Instructions that perform operations on data, including arithmetic and logical operations.

**Data Representation**: The method used to represent information in a computer. Common forms include binary, hexadecimal, and decimal representations.

**Debugging**: The process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program.

**DSP (Digital Signal Processing)**: The numerical manipulation of signals, typically with the intention of measurement, filtering, producing, or compressing continuous analog signals.

**Emulator**: A software that mimics the behavior of a hardware device or another software environment, often used for testing and development.

**Exception Handling**: Mechanisms in place to manage and respond to exceptional conditions (such as errors) in a program.

**General Purpose Registers**: Registers in a CPU that can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as holding data, addresses, or intermediate results.

**Heap**: A region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation where blocks of memory are allocated and freed in an arbitrary order.

**Immediate Addressing**: An addressing mode where the operand is specified directly in the instruction.

**Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: The part of the computer architecture related to programming, which includes the set of instructions the processor can execute.

**Interrupt**: A signal to the processor indicating that an event needs immediate attention. The processor responds by pausing its current activity, saving its state, and executing an interrupt service routine (ISR).

**Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**: A special block of code associated with a specific interrupt condition.

**I/O (Input/Output)**: Operations that involve transferring data to and from a computer and the external world, such as reading data from a keyboard or writing data to a display.

**Load Instruction**: An instruction that copies data from memory to a register.

**Machine Code**: The lowest-level representation of a program, consisting of binary instructions that the CPU can directly execute.

**Memory Architecture**: The structure and organization of memory in a computer system, including the layout of memory addresses and the methods used to access memory.

**Memory-Mapped I/O**: A method of interfacing I/O devices with the CPU by assigning device registers to specific memory addresses.

**Optimization**: The process of making a program more efficient, typically in terms of execution speed or memory usage.

**OS (Operating System)**: Software that manages hardware resources and provides services for computer programs.

**Registers**: Small, fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold data that is being processed.

**Stack**: A data structure used for storing a sequence of data elements, where the last element added is the first one to be removed (LIFO: Last In, First Out).

**Stack Frame**: A section of the stack that contains data for a single subroutine call, including parameters, local variables, and return addresses.

**Subroutine**: A sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can be invoked from various points in the program.

**Syntax**: The set of rules and structures used to write code in a particular programming language.

**Timers**: Peripheral devices used to measure time intervals, often used in real-time applications and embedded systems.
