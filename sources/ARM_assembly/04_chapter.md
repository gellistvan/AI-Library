### First Program: Hello World

Writing your first program in ARM assembly language is an exciting step towards understanding low-level programming and the ARM architecture. This chapter will guide you through the process of writing, assembling, and running a simple "Hello World" program. We will cover each step in detail, from understanding the structure of an ARM assembly program to using the tools you've installed to assemble and run your code.

#### Understanding the ARM Assembly Language

Before diving into the code, it's essential to understand the basics of the ARM assembly language and its structure. ARM assembly language consists of a set of instructions that the ARM processor can execute. Each instruction typically performs a simple operation, such as moving data between registers, performing arithmetic operations, or controlling program flow.

**Key Components of an ARM Assembly Program:**

1. **Sections**: ARM assembly programs are divided into sections, with the most common being `.text` for code and `.data` for data.
2. **Labels**: Labels are used to mark positions in the code, allowing for easier reference and branching.
3. **Instructions**: Instructions are the commands executed by the CPU, such as `MOV`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `B`, etc.
4. **Directives**: Directives provide the assembler with information about the program, such as `.global` to declare global symbols.

#### Writing the "Hello World" Program

Let's write a simple "Hello World" program that outputs the message to the console. This program will involve system calls to interact with the operating system, a typical approach for such tasks in low-level programming.

**Step-by-Step Code Explanation:**

1. **Section Declaration**:
   ```assembly
   .section .data
   message: .asciz "Hello, World!\n"
   ```

    - `.section .data`: Declares the data section where initialized data is stored.
    - `message`: Defines a label for the string.
    - `.asciz`: Assembles the string as a null-terminated ASCII string.

2. **Text Section and Entry Point**:
   ```assembly
   .section .text
   .global _start
   _start:
   ```

    - `.section .text`: Declares the text section where code is stored.
    - `.global _start`: Makes the `_start` label globally accessible (the entry point for the program).
    - `_start`: Defines the label for the program's entry point.

3. **Load Address and Length of the Message**:
   ```assembly
   ldr r0, =1          @ file descriptor 1 (stdout)
   ldr r1, =message    @ address of the string
   ldr r2, =13         @ length of the string
   ```

    - `ldr r0, =1`: Loads the immediate value `1` (file descriptor for stdout) into register `r0`.
    - `ldr r1, =message`: Loads the address of the `message` string into register `r1`.
    - `ldr r2, =13`: Loads the immediate value `13` (length of the string) into register `r2`.

4. **System Call for Writing to stdout**:
   ```assembly
   mov r7, #4          @ syscall number for sys_write
   svc 0               @ invoke the system call
   ```

    - `mov r7, #4`: Moves the system call number `4` (sys_write) into register `r7`.
    - `svc 0`: Supervisor call to execute the system call.

5. **Exit the Program**:
   ```assembly
   mov r0, #0          @ exit code 0
   mov r7, #1          @ syscall number for sys_exit
   svc 0               @ invoke the system call
   ```

    - `mov r0, #0`: Moves the exit code `0` into register `r0`.
    - `mov r7, #1`: Moves the system call number `1` (sys_exit) into register `r7`.
    - `svc 0`: Supervisor call to execute the system call.

**Complete Program**:

```assembly
.section .data
message: .asciz "Hello, World!\n"

.section .text
.global _start
_start:
    ldr r0, =1          @ file descriptor 1 (stdout)
    ldr r1, =message    @ address of the string
    ldr r2, =13         @ length of the string
    mov r7, #4          @ syscall number for sys_write
    svc 0               @ invoke the system call

    mov r0, #0          @ exit code 0
    mov r7, #1          @ syscall number for sys_exit
    svc 0               @ invoke the system call
```

#### Assembling the Program

Once you have written your ARM assembly program, the next step is to assemble it into machine code. This process involves using an assembler to convert your assembly code into an object file.

1. **Save the Program**:
    - Save the above code in a file named `hello_world.s`.

2. **Assemble the Program**:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory containing `hello_world.s`.
    - Run the following command to assemble the program using the GNU Assembler:
      ```sh
      arm-none-eabi-as -o hello_world.o hello_world.s
      ```

    - This command invokes the assembler (`as`), specifying the output file (`-o hello_world.o`) and the input file (`hello_world.s`).

#### Linking the Program

After assembling the program into an object file, the next step is to link it into an executable file. The linker combines object files and resolves references between them, producing an executable that can be loaded and run by the operating system.

1. **Link the Program**:
    - Run the following command to link the object file:
      ```sh
      arm-none-eabi-ld -o hello_world.elf hello_world.o
      ```

    - This command invokes the linker (`ld`), specifying the output file (`-o hello_world.elf`) and the input file (`hello_world.o`).

#### Running the Program

Finally, you can run the program using an emulator such as QEMU. This allows you to simulate an ARM environment on your development machine.

1. **Running the Program with QEMU**:
    - Ensure QEMU is installed and properly configured (refer to the previous chapter for installation steps).
    - Run the following command to execute the program:
      ```sh
      qemu-arm -L /usr/arm-none-eabi -N -kernel hello_world.elf
      ```

    - This command invokes QEMU (`qemu-arm`), specifying the path to the ARM libraries (`-L /usr/arm-none-eabi`), disabling the address randomization (`-N`), and specifying the kernel (or executable) file (`-kernel hello_world.elf`).

2. **Verifying the Output**:
    - If everything is set up correctly, you should see the message "Hello, World!" printed to the console.

#### Detailed Explanation of System Calls

In ARM assembly programming, interacting with the operating system is done through system calls. These calls provide a way to request services from the kernel, such as writing to a file or exiting a program. Understanding how to use system calls is crucial for writing functional assembly programs.

1. **Syscall Interface**:
    - In ARM Linux, system calls are made using the `svc` (supervisor call) instruction.
    - The syscall number is placed in register `r7`.
    - Arguments are passed in registers `r0` to `r6`.

2. **Common Syscalls Used in "Hello World"**:
    - **sys_write (number 4)**:
        - Writes data to a file descriptor.
        - Arguments:
            - `r0`: File descriptor (1 for stdout).
            - `r1`: Pointer to the data (address of the string).
            - `r2`: Number of bytes to write (length of the string).
    - **sys_exit (number 1)**:
        - Terminates the process.
        - Arguments:
            - `r0`: Exit code.

3. **System Call Example**:
   ```assembly
   mov r7, #4          @ syscall number for sys_write
   svc 0               @ invoke the system call
   ```

    - This code sets up the system call for `sys_write` by moving the syscall number `4` into `r7` and then executing the `svc 0` instruction to make the call.

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

While assembling and running your first ARM assembly program, you may encounter various issues. Here are some common problems and their solutions:

1. **Assembler Errors**:
    - **Error**: `Error: bad instruction 'xyz'`
        - **Solution**: Check for typos or unsupported instructions in your code.
    - **Error**: `Error: can't open file 'hello_world.s': No such file or directory`
        - **Solution**: Ensure the file exists and the path is correct.

2. **Linker Errors**:
    - **Error**: `Error: undefined reference to 'xyz'`
        - **Solution**: Ensure all labels and references in your code are correct and defined.

3. **Runtime Errors**:
    - **Error**: `Segmentation fault`
        - **Solution**: Check for incorrect memory accesses or invalid pointers.
    - **Error**: `Illegal instruction`
        - **Solution**: Ensure the instructions used are supported by the target architecture.
