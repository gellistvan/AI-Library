    - Common image formats include JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

2. **Image Processing**
    - Basic operations include filtering, convolution, and transformation.
    - Techniques such as edge detection, thresholding, and morphological operations are used to preprocess and analyze images.

3. **Feature Extraction**
    - Key points, edges, and regions of interest are identified to describe the image content.
    - Common feature detectors include SIFT, SURF, and ORB.

4. **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
    - Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques are applied to classify and recognize patterns in images.
    - Deep learning models, particularly CNNs, have become the standard for many computer vision tasks.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
    - Performance of computer vision systems is measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Confusion matrices and ROC curves are used to evaluate classification results.
