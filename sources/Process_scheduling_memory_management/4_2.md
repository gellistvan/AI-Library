        elif len(self.cache) >= self.capacity:
            lru_key = self.usage_order.pop(0)
            del self.cache[lru_key]
        self.cache[key] = value
        self.usage_order.append(key)
    
    def energy_efficient_get(self, key, alternative_source):
        data = self.get(key)
        if data == -1:
            data = alternative_source()
            self.put(key, data)
        return data

t_sim = 100.0  # Total simulation time (ms)
steps = int(t_sim / dt)
time = np.arange(0, t_sim, dt)

# Initialize membrane potential
v_m = v_rest * np.ones(steps)
for t in range(1, steps):
    dv = (-(v_m[t - 1] - v_rest) + i_mean) / tau_m
    v_m[t] = v_m[t - 1] + dv * dt
    if v_m[t] >= v_threshold:
