### Comprehensive List of Development Tools

Understanding and optimizing process scheduling and memory management in Linux is a multifaceted task that benefits significantly from the use of various development tools. These tools range from debugging and profiling utilities to system monitoring and performance assessment frameworks. Each tool provides unique insights into the behavior and performance of processes and memory on a Linux system. Here, we delve deeply into a comprehensive list of essential development tools, detailing their functionalities, usage, and best practices.

#### Debugging Tools

**1. GDB (GNU Debugger):**
GDB is an indispensable tool for debugging applications in Linux. It allows developers to inspect what is happening inside a program while it executes or what it was doing at the moment it crashed. GDB supports a wide range of programming languages, including C, C++, and Fortran.

- **Usage:** To start debugging, compile your code with debugging information using the `-g` flag (e.g., `g++ -g your_code.cpp -o your_program`), then run `gdb ./your_program`.
- **Features:** Setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, stepping through the code line by line, and examining the call stack.
- **Example:**
```bash
# To set a breakpoint at the start of the main function
(gdb) break main
# To run the program
(gdb) run
# To inspect the value of a variable
(gdb) print variable_name
```

**2. Valgrind:**
Valgrind is a powerful suite of tools for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling. Its most well-known tool, Memcheck, detects memory errors such as illegal memory accesses and memory leaks.

- **Usage:** To run a program with Memcheck, use the command `valgrind --tool=memcheck ./your_program`.
- **Features:** Detecting invalid memory use, identifying memory leaks, tracking heap memory usage.
- **Example:**
```bash
# To check for memory leaks
valgrind --leak-check=full ./your_program
```

**3. strace:**
strace traces system calls and signals received by a process. It is particularly useful for debugging elusive errors by providing a detailed trace of system call invocations.

- **Usage:** Run a program with strace using `strace ./your_program`.
- **Features:** Tracing system calls, inspecting syscall parameters and return values, monitoring process interactions with the OS.
- **Example:**
```bash
# To trace all system calls made by a program
strace ./your_program
```

**4. perf:**
perf is a versatile performance profiling tool in the Linux kernel that helps in analyzing the performance and behavior of systems, from hardware-level issues up to complex software-level problems.

- **Usage:** Use `perf stat` for a summary of various performance counters and `perf record` followed by `perf report` for detailed profiling.
- **Features:** Performance monitoring, profiling CPU cycles, cache misses, and instructions executed.
- **Example:**
```bash
# To monitor CPU performance counters
perf stat ./your_program
# To record and report events
perf record ./your_program
perf report
```

#### Profiling Tools

**1. gprof:**
gprof is a profiling program that collects and displays profiling statistics, such as function call counts and execution time.

- **Usage:** Compile your program with profiling enabled using the `-pg` flag, then run it and use `gprof` to generate the report.
- **Features:** Function call frequency, execution time analysis, graphical call graph.
- **Example:**
```bash
# Compile with profiling enabled
g++ -pg your_code.cpp -o your_program
# Run the program
./your_program
# Generate profiling report
gprof ./your_program gmon.out > profiling_report.txt
```

**2. OProfile:**
OProfile is a system-wide profiling tool with support for various CPU architectures. It can profile all running code at low overhead.

- **Usage:** Start profiling using `opcontrol` to configure and start the profiler, then use `opreport` to generate and view reports.
- **Features:** Profiling kernel and user code, low overhead, detailed system-wide analysis.
- **Example:**
```bash
# Start the profiler
opcontrol --start
# Run your program
./your_program
