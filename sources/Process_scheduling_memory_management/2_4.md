## 6. Scheduling Implementation

In the realm of operating systems, the efficiency and fairness of process scheduling play pivotal roles in ensuring optimal system performance. The Linux operating system, known for its robustness and versatility, implements process scheduling through a well-defined hierarchy of data structures and algorithms. This chapter delves into the intricate mechanisms underpinning scheduling in the Linux kernel. We will explore the fundamental scheduler data structures that form the backbone of the scheduling framework, including the essential task structs and runqueues. We will also dissect the diverse scheduling classes and policies that cater to various workload requirements, offering both general-purpose and real-time capabilities. By understanding these components, we gain insights into how Linux achieves balanced and efficient process management, allowing it to handle a wide spectrum of computational demands.

### Scheduler Data Structures

The intricacies of Linux process scheduling are tightly interwoven with its underlying data structures. These data structures form the blueprint of how processes are managed, prioritized, and dispatched. Understanding these fundamental components is essential for anyone delving deep into the Linux kernel's scheduling mechanisms.

#### 1. Understanding the Task Struct

The `task_struct` is the quintessential data structure in Linux, encapsulating the state of a process. Located in the /include/linux/sched.h header file, it contains a plethora of fields that describe nearly every aspect of a process's state, resources, and scheduled activities.

1.1. Essential Fields of `task_struct`:
   - **pid**: The process identifier, a unique number distinguishing the process.
   - **state**: Describes the current state of the process (e.g., TASK_RUNNING, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE).
   - **policy**: Defines the scheduling policy applied to the process (e.g., SCHED_NORMAL, SCHED_FIFO).
   - **prio**: Indicates the dynamic priority of the process.
   - **static_prio**: Reflects the base priority assigned to the process, unaffected by dynamic adjustments.
   - **normal_prio**: The effective priority used by the scheduler to determine run queues.
   - **se (sched_entity)**: An embedded data structure crucial for fair scheduling, part of the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS).
   - **rt (rt_rq)**: Represents the real-time scheduling parameters and statistics.

```C
struct task_struct {
    pid_t pid;
    volatile long state; 
    int prio, static_prio, normal_prio;
    struct sched_entity se;
    struct rt_rq *rt_rq;
    // Additional fields...
};
```

The `task_struct` is a colossal structure and carries immense amounts of information, such as memory management information (mm_struct), file descriptor tables (files_struct), signal handling settings (signal_struct), and much more. These fields empower the kernel to perform nuanced and efficient process management.

#### 2. The Runqueue Structure

At the core of the scheduling system lies the `runqueue`, a pivotal structure that holds all the processes ready to be executed on the CPU. Each processor in the system maintains its own runqueue to support symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), enhancing parallel processing capability.

2.1 Anatomy of `runqueue`:
   - **nr_running**: A tally of the tasks currently runnable/unblocked.
   - **cfs_rq (CFS runqueue)**: Records the state of the fair scheduling entities (tasks) handled by the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS).
   - **rt_rq (RT runqueue)**: Comprises real-time tasks managed by the real-time scheduler.
   - **cpu**: Identifies the CPU associated with this runqueue, fundamental in multi-core systems.
   - **lock**: A spinlock to safeguard the runqueue from concurrent access.

```C
struct rq {
    unsigned int nr_running;
    struct cfs_rq cfs;
    struct rt_rq rt;
    unsigned int cpu;
    raw_spinlock_t lock;
    // Additional fields...
};
```

In a multiprocessing environment, per-CPU runqueues help in distributing the scheduling load and minimize contention, thereby reducing latency and increasing throughput.

#### 3. The Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) Data Structures

The CFS is the principal scheduler for normal (non-real-time) tasks in Linux. By modeling processes as virtual run-time entities using red-black trees, it aims to distribute CPU time as evenly as possible.

3.1. The `sched_entity` Struct:
   - **load (load_weight)**: Defines the load impact of this entity on the scheduling algorithm.
   - **exec_start**: Timestamp marking when the entity last began execution.
   - **vruntime**: The virtual runtime metric used to evaluate process fairness.
   - **run_node**: The node object for inserting the entity into the red-black tree.

```C
struct sched_entity {
    struct load_weight load;
    unsigned long exec_start;
    unsigned long vruntime;
    struct rb_node run_node;
    // Additional fields...
};
```

3.2. The `cfs_rq` Struct:
   - **nr_running**: Indicates the number of CFS tasks in this runqueue.
   - **load**: Represents the cumulative load of all runnable entities.
   - **min_vruntime**: The minimal virtual runtime value amongst the entities, ensuring the fairest next task selection.
   - **tasks_timeline**: The red-black tree facilitating efficient scheduling decisions.

```C
struct cfs_rq {
    unsigned long nr_running;
    struct load_weight load;
    unsigned long min_vruntime;
    struct rb_root tasks_timeline;
    // Additional fields...
};
```

The integration of these structures within the runqueue ensures that CFS can efficiently schedule processes in a way that approximates proportional share scheduling across all runnable tasks.

#### 4. Real-Time Scheduling Data Structures

Real-time tasks require deterministic and highly responsive scheduling. Linux supports several real-time scheduling policies, each accommodating different needs.

4.1. The `rt_rq` Struct:
   - **rt_nr_running**: Number of real-time tasks waiting to be executed.
   - **highest_prio**: The highest priority real-time task in the runqueue.
   - **queue**: Priority table holding lists of real-time tasks categorized by priority.

```C
struct rt_rq {
    unsigned int rt_nr_running;
    struct list_head queue[MAX_RT_PRIO];
    unsigned long highest_prio;
    // Additional fields...
};
```

The Real-Time runqueue ensures prompt handling of high-priority tasks, offering predictable timing behavior essential for real-time applications.

#### 5. Interplay of Scheduler Structures and Multi-Core Processors

Modern processors with multiple cores necessitate sophisticated mechanisms to distribute processes effectively and maintain load balance. Per-CPU runqueues are central to achieving this goal.

5.1. Load Balancing:
   - CFS implements load balancing to prevent CPU starvation. 
   - Periodic rebalancing ensures tasks are moved between CPUs to maintain a balanced system.
   - Metrics like CPU load and task priority are considered during this process.

```C++
void rebalance_domains(struct rq *rq, enum cpu_idle_type idle) {
    int this_cpu = rq->cpu;
    struct sched_domain *sd;
    for_each_domain(this_cpu, sd) {
        if (sd_lb_stats(sd)->balance_interval < jiffies)
            lb_balance(sd, this_cpu, idle);
    }
}
```

Load balancing maintains optimal system performance by preventing some CPUs from being overburdened while others remain underutilized.

#### Conclusion

The scheduler data structures in Linux set the stage for efficient process management and CPU time distribution. The comprehensively designed `task_struct`, coupled with the dynamic `runqueues`, and the sophisticated handling of fair and real-time scheduling, provide Linux with powerful and flexible process scheduling capabilities. This deep dive into the scheduler's data structures elucidates the meticulous planning and complexity inherent in Linux's approach to maintaining smooth and responsive system operation across diverse workloads and processor architectures. Understanding these components equips us with a greater appreciation of the scheduler's role in Linux's operational excellence.

### Task Struct and Runqueues

The efficiency and performance of an operating system's scheduler are pivotal in determining how various processes share the CPU time. In Linux, the `task_struct` and `runqueue` are two critical data structures that significantly influence scheduling decisions. This chapter explores these structures in detail, highlighting their roles, interactions, and implications on the overall scheduling mechanics.

#### 1. The Anatomy of `task_struct`

The `task_struct`, often referred to as the process descriptor, embodies the comprehensive state and metadata of a process. This structure is declared in the /include/linux/sched.h header file and is arguably one of the most complex and extensive structures in the Linux kernel. Each process in the system has its corresponding `task_struct`, with fields capturing nearly every aspect of process execution and resource management.

1.1. Key Fields in `task_struct`:

1. **Identifiers:**
   - **pid_t pid**: The unique process identifier.
   - **pid_t tgid**: Thread group identifier, significant for threading models where multiple threads share the same thread group.

2. **State Information:**
   - **volatile long state**: Maintains the current state of the process (e.g., TASK_RUNNING, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, TASK_STOPPED, TASK_TRACED, TASK_DEAD, EXIT_ZOMBIE, EXIT_DEAD).

3. **Scheduling Attributes:**
   - **int prio**: Dynamic priority used during scheduling.
   - **int static_prio**: The base priority of the process.
   - **int normal_prio**: Represents the priority value after considering adjustments.
   - **struct sched_entity se**: Embodies the scheduling entity used by the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS).
   - **struct rt_entity rt**: Represents real-time scheduling parameters.

4. **Time-keeping:**
   - **cputime_t utime**: User mode CPU time.
   - **cputime_t stime**: System mode CPU time.
   - **cputime_t nvcsw, nivcsw**: Voluntary and involuntary context switches.

5. **Memory Management:**
   - **struct mm_struct *mm**: Points to the memory descriptor containing the process's address space.
   - **struct mm_struct *active_mm**: Active memory descriptor, especially crucial during context switching.

6. **File System:**
   - **struct files_struct *files**: Points to the file descriptor table.
   - **struct fs_struct *fs**: Tracks filesystem-related information such as the current working directory and root directory.

7. **Signals and Exit State:**
   - **struct signal_struct *signal**: Shared signal handling settings within a thread group.
   - **int exit_code, exit_state**: Captures the process's exit code and state.

```C
struct task_struct {
    pid_t pid;
    pid_t tgid;
    volatile long state; 
    int prio, static_prio, normal_prio;
    struct sched_entity se;
    struct rt_entity rt;
    cputime_t utime, stime;
    cputime_t nvcsw, nivcsw;
    struct mm_struct *mm, *active_mm;
    struct files_struct *files;
    struct fs_struct *fs;
    struct signal_struct *signal;
    int exit_code, exit_state;
    // Additional fields...
};
```

1.2. `sched_entity` and `rt_entity`:
   These embedded structures are integral to process scheduling. The `sched_entity` is used by the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) to maintain fairness among tasks by leveraging a virtual runtime metric, while the `rt_entity` focuses on managing the characteristics and behaviors of real-time tasks.

#### 2. Runqueues: The Repository of Runnable Tasks

The runqueue (`rq`) structure is central to managing the list of runnable processes. Each CPU in a multi-core system has its own runqueue to prevent contention and maximize parallelism. The structure ensures that tasks ready for execution are managed efficiently, thereby minimizing scheduling latency and maximizing CPU utilization.

2.1. Key Components of `runqueue`:

1. **Task Count:**
   - **unsigned int nr_running**: The number of tasks that are currently in the runnable state.

2. **Scheduling Classes:**
   - **struct cfs_rq cfs**: Represents the runqueue for the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS).
   - **struct rt_rq rt**: Captures the runqueue for real-time tasks.

3. **CPU Association:**
   - **unsigned int cpu**: The CPU identifier for which this runqueue is associated.

4. **Locking Mechanism:**
   - **raw_spinlock_t lock**: A spinlock to guard the runqueue against concurrent accesses, especially crucial in a multi-threaded environment.

5. **Load Balancing:**
   - **unsigned long cpu_load**: Tracks the load on the CPU to aid in load balancing decisions.
   - **struct list_head leaf_cfs_rq_list**: Keeps a list of CFS runqueues at the leaf level, aiding hierarchical scheduling.

```C
struct rq {
    unsigned int nr_running;
    struct cfs_rq cfs;
    struct rt_rq rt;
    unsigned int cpu;
    raw_spinlock_t lock;
    unsigned long cpu_load;
    struct list_head leaf_cfs_rq_list;
    // Additional fields...
};
```

2.2. The Role of `cfs_rq` and `rt_rq`:

These substructures within the runqueue are instrumental in distinguishing between fair-scheduled tasks and real-time tasks. The Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) runqueue (`cfs_rq`) manages tasks in a red-black tree to maintain a balanced search tree for efficient scheduling decisions. On the other hand, the real-time runqueue (`rt_rq`) uses priority-based lists to keep track of high-priority tasks, ensuring predictability and stringent deadline adherence.

2.3. The Dispatch Queue:

Each runqueue maintains a dispatch queue—which is an encapsulated list of tasks currently ready to be scheduled on the CPU. This dynamically updated list ensures that the scheduler has quick access to the next task to dispatch, minimizing context switch overhead.

#### 3. Interactions Between `task_struct` and `runqueue`

The interplay between `task_struct` and runqueues forms the bedrock of the Linux scheduling framework. When a new process is created, its `task_struct` is initialized and linked to its parent process. The scheduling policy and priority are set, determining its placement in the appropriate runqueue.

3.1. Enqueuing and Dequeuing:

1. **Enqueuing**:
   When a task transitions to the runnable state, the scheduler enqueues the corresponding `task_struct` into the CPU's runqueue. If it's a CFS task, it's placed in the cfs runqueue (`cfs_rq`). If it’s a real-time task, it’s added to the rt runqueue (`rt_rq`).

```C
static void enqueue_task(struct task_struct* p, struct rq* rq) {
    if (p->policy == SCHED_NORMAL || p->policy == SCHED_BATCH) {
        enqueue_task_fair(rq, &p->se, 0);
    } else if (p->policy == SCHED_FIFO || p->policy == SCHED_RR) {
        enqueue_task_rt(rq, &p->rt, 0);
    }
    // Additional policies...
}
```

2. **Dequeuing**:
   When a task is no longer runnable (e.g., due to waiting for I/O or completion), it's dequeued from the runqueue. This involves removing the task's `sched_entity` or `rt_entity` from their respective structures, updating the runqueue's task count.

```C
static void dequeue_task(struct task_struct* p, struct rq* rq) {
    if (p->policy == SCHED_NORMAL || p->policy == SCHED_BATCH) {
        dequeue_task_fair(rq, &p->se, 0);
    } else if (p->policy == SCHED_FIFO || p->policy == SCHED_RR) {
        dequeue_task_rt(rq, &p->rt, 0);
    }
    // Additional policies...
}
```

3.2. Context Switching:

When the scheduler decides to switch processes, it saves the context of the currently running process—including its CPU registers and program counter—back into its `task_struct`. Then, it retrieves the context of the next scheduled process from its `task_struct`, restoring its state so it can continue execution.

The interplay of these data structures ensures a balanced and responsive system. By maintaining detailed process states and runnable tasks, `task_struct` and runqueues orchestrate effective CPU utilization and workload distribution.

#### Conclusion

The `task_struct` and runqueue structures are cornerstones of the Linux scheduling mechanism. Their meticulous design and intricate interactions underpin the scheduler's ability to manage processes efficiently. By capturing comprehensive state information in `task_struct` and organizing runnable tasks through runqueues, Linux ensures optimal CPU time allocation, prioritization, and responsiveness. Understanding these structures not only demystifies the scheduler's operations but also highlights the sophisticated engineering that enables Linux's performance and scalability.

### Scheduling Classes and Policies

The Linux scheduler is a sophisticated entity, designed to manage diverse types of processes with varying demands on CPU resources. Central to its efficiency and versatility are its scheduling classes and policies. These constructs not only enable the scheduler to prioritize tasks appropriately but also ensure fairness, responsiveness, and real-time capabilities. This chapter delves into the architecture of scheduling classes and policies in the Linux kernel, examining their roles, mechanisms, and underlying principles.

#### 1. Introduction to Scheduling Classes

Scheduling classes in the Linux kernel provide a modular framework where different scheduling algorithms can coexist, applied to different types of processes or workload requirements. Each scheduling class is independent and implements specific scheduling logic. The hierarchy and order of scheduling classes determine the priority and order in which tasks are selected for execution.

1.1. Anatomy of a Scheduling Class:

Scheduling classes are defined by the `sched_class` structure located in /include/linux/sched.h. This structure includes function pointers to various operations like task enqueue, dequeue, pick next task, put task to sleep, and more.

Key fields in `sched_class`:
   - **enqueue_task**: Function to enqueue a task into the runqueue.
   - **dequeue_task**: Function to dequeue a task from the runqueue.
   - **pick_next_task**: Function to pick the next task from the runqueue for execution.
   - **yield_task**: Function to yield the processor voluntarily.
   - **check_preempt_curr**: Function to check whether the current task should be preempted.
   - **set_curr_task**: Function to set the current task on the CPU.
   - **task_tick**: Function called on each scheduler tick for housekeeping.

```C
struct sched_class {
    void (*enqueue_task) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p, int flags);
    void (*dequeue_task) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p, int flags);
    struct task_struct *(*pick_next_task) (struct rq *rq);
    void (*yield_task) (struct rq *rq);
    void (*check_preempt_curr) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);
    void (*set_curr_task) (struct rq *rq);
    void (*task_tick) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p);
    // Additional fields...
};
```

Each scheduling class specializes in managing tasks according to specific criteria, such as fairness, deadline constraints, or priority.

#### 2. The Main Scheduling Classes

Let's explore the main scheduling classes in the Linux kernel and understand their respective roles and characteristics.

2.1. The Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS):

CFS is the default scheduler for normal tasks (SCHED_NORMAL) and batch tasks (SCHED_BATCH). Its primary goal is to ensure fair distribution of CPU time among all running tasks. CFS uses a red-black tree to manage scheduling entities, which allows it to efficiently calculate the virtual runtime (`vruntime`) of tasks.

- **Fairness Principle**: CFS approximates an ideal multitasking scenario where each task gets an equal share of the CPU.
- **Virtual Runtime**: Each task's `vruntime` is incremented based on its actual runtime adjusted by a weight derived from its priority.
- **Scheduler Entity**: CFS uses the `sched_entity` structure embedded in the `task_struct` to manage tasks in the red-black tree.

Key operations in CFS:
   - **enqueue_task_fair**: Adds a task to the CFS runqueue.
   - **dequeue_task_fair**: Removes a task from the CFS runqueue.
   - **pick_next_task_fair**: Selects the next task to run based on the lowest `vruntime`.

```C
struct sched_class fair_sched_class = {
    .enqueue_task = enqueue_task_fair,
    .dequeue_task = dequeue_task_fair,
    .pick_next_task = pick_next_task_fair,
    // Additional operations...
};
```

2.2. Real-Time (RT) Scheduler:

The RT scheduler handles real-time tasks, which require predictable and low-latency scheduling. RT scheduling classes include SCHED_FIFO (First-In, First-Out) and SCHED_RR (Round Robin). These schedules are designed to provide deterministic guarantees necessary for real-time applications.

- **SCHED_FIFO**: Tasks are executed in the order they are dequeued until they voluntarily yield or are preempted by a higher-priority task.
- **SCHED_RR**: Similar to SCHED_FIFO but incorporates time slices to allow round-robin execution among tasks of the same priority.

Key operations in RT scheduler:
   - **enqueue_task_rt**: Adds a real-time task to the RT runqueue.
   - **dequeue_task_rt**: Removes a real-time task from the RT runqueue.
   - **pick_next_task_rt**: Selects the next real-time task to execute, prioritizing based on static priority.

```C
struct sched_class rt_sched_class = {
    .enqueue_task = enqueue_task_rt,
    .dequeue_task = dequeue_task_rt,
    .pick_next_task = pick_next_task_rt,
    // Additional operations...
};
```

2.3. Deadline Scheduler:

The Deadline Scheduler (SCHED_DEADLINE) is an advanced scheduler designed for tasks with stringent timing constraints, such as those found in multimedia and telecommunications applications. It uses Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and constant bandwidth server (CBS) algorithms to manage task deadlines and execution.

- **Guaranteed Execution**: Ensures that tasks meet their deadlines by dynamically adjusting priorities.
- **Bandwidth Allocation**: Limits CPU time to prevent overruns, maintaining overall system stability.

Key operations in Deadline scheduler:
   - **enqueue_task_dl**: Adds a deadline task to the deadline runqueue.
   - **dequeue_task_dl**: Removes a deadline task from the deadline runqueue.
   - **pick_next_task_dl**: Chooses the next task to execute based on deadlines.

```C
struct sched_class dl_sched_class = {
    .enqueue_task = enqueue_task_dl,
    .dequeue_task = dequeue_task_dl,
    .pick_next_task = pick_next_task_dl,
    // Additional operations...
};
```

#### 3. Scheduling Policies

Scheduling policies in Linux define the criteria by which tasks are chosen for execution within their respective scheduling classes. Each task is associated with a specific scheduling policy, defined by the `policy` field in `task_struct`.

3.1. Normal Scheduling Policies:

1. **SCHED_NORMAL**: Also known as SCHED_OTHER, this is the default policy for regular user processes. It uses the CFS to allocate CPU time based on task priority and load.
2. **SCHED_BATCH**: Intended for non-interactive processes with minimal scheduling overhead. This policy minimizes context switches, allowing tasks to run longer without being preempted.

3.2. Real-Time Scheduling Policies:

1. **SCHED_FIFO**: A real-time, first-in-first-out policy where the highest-priority task runs until it voluntarily yields the CPU or a higher-priority task preempts it. Suitable for tasks requiring immediate execution without interruptions.
2. **SCHED_RR**: A real-time, round-robin policy similar to SCHED_FIFO but with time slices. When a task's time slice expires, it moves to the end of the queue for its priority level, preventing single processes from monopolizing the CPU.

3.3. Deadline Scheduling Policy:

1. **SCHED_DEADLINE**: Designed for tasks with explicit deadline requirements. The scheduler ensures tasks are executed within specified periods, crucial for time-sensitive applications. Parameters include runtime, deadline, and period values, guiding the scheduler to meet task timing constraints.

#### 4. Interaction Between Classes and Policies

The Linux scheduler's architecture ensures seamless interaction between scheduling classes and policies, creating a dynamic and adaptive scheduling environment.

4.1. Decision Making:

The scheduler evaluates the policies and priorities of all tasks within the runqueue. Depending on the assigned policy, the scheduler class determines the specific algorithm to pick the next task. High-priority real-time tasks (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR) can preempt lower-priority normal and deadline tasks, while the deadline scheduler ensures tasks with imminent deadlines receive appropriate CPU time.

4.2. Preemption & Context Switching:

Preemption is a critical feature enabling the scheduler to interrupt the currently running task to run a higher-priority task. The `check_preempt_curr` and `pick_next_task` operations are crucial here, ensuring that the most appropriate task is selected based on the current scheduling policy and class hierarchy.

```C
void check_preempt_curr(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p, int flags) {
    // Check if the current task should be preempted.
    if (rq->curr->prio > p->prio) {
        resched_curr(rq);
    }
    // Additional checks for real-time and deadline tasks...
}
```

4.3. Load Balancing:

In a multi-core system, load balancing ensures that no single CPU is overburdened. The scheduler periodically redistributes tasks across CPUs to maintain balance. Load balancing takes into account the different scheduling classes and policies, ensuring optimal performance.

#### 5. Advanced Topics in Scheduling Classes and Policies

5.1. Group Scheduling and Hierarchical CFS:

Group scheduling allows processes to be grouped, with each group treated as a single schedulable entity. This hierarchical approach ensures fairness not just among individual tasks but also among groups of tasks.

- **CFS Group Scheduling**: CFS supports hierarchical scheduling entities, enabling resource allocation across groups based on group weights.

```C
struct cfs_rq {
    struct load_weight load;
    struct rb_root tasks_timeline;
    struct sched_entity *curr;
    struct sched_entity **_runtime;
    // Additional fields for group scheduling...
};
```

5.2. Real-Time Bandwidth Control:

Real-time tasks can monopolize CPU resources, potentially starving lower-priority tasks. Real-time bandwidth control (enabled via /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us) restricts the amount of time real-time tasks can consume, ensuring system responsiveness.

```Bash
echo 950000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
```

#### 6. Conclusion

Linux's scheduling classes and policies form a robust and adaptable framework suitable for a broad spectrum of application requirements. By leveraging distinct scheduling algorithms encapsulated within classes, Linux ensures that tasks are managed efficiently and fairly, meeting the diverse needs of user applications, from interactive shell commands to real-time multimedia processing.

Understanding these classes and policies, along with their interactions and nuances, equips system developers and kernel programmers with the knowledge necessary to optimize system performance and behavior. The sophisticated design of the Linux scheduler reflects its evolution to meet increasing computational demands, scalability, and real-time constraints, underscoring its position as a premier operating system kernel.
