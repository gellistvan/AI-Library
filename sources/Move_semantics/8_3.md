## Appendix C: Example Code and Exercises

In this appendix, we compile a variety of sample programs and exercises designed to reinforce the concepts covered in this book. These hands-on examples provide practical demonstrations of move semantics, rvalue references, and perfect forwarding, illustrating how they can be effectively utilized in real-world scenarios. The exercises included will challenge your understanding and help solidify the techniques you've learned, ensuring you gain a thorough mastery of these powerful features in modern C++. As you work through this appendix, you'll not only deepen your comprehension but also build the confidence to apply these techniques in your own projects.

### Sample Programs Demonstrating Key Concepts

The aim of this subchapter is to provide a deep dive into the practical applications of move semantics, rvalue references, and perfect forwarding. By examining carefully constructed example programs, you'll gain insights into these advanced C++ features, learning not just the theory but also the best practices for their application. This will include an exploration of their syntax, semantics, and performance implications.

#### Understanding Move Semantics

Move semantics in C++ is designed to optimize the performance by eliminating unnecessary copying of objects. Instead of copying data, move semantics transfers ownership of the resources from one object to another, significantly improving efficiency, especially for objects that manage dynamic memory or other system resources.

##### Basic Move Semantics

Let's start with a basic understanding of move semantics using a simple example. Consider a class `MyVector` that encapsulates a dynamic array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class MyVector {
public:
    MyVector(size_t size) : size(size), data(new int[size]) {
        std::cout << "Constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    ~MyVector() {
        delete[] data;
    }

    // Move constructor
    MyVector(MyVector&& other) noexcept
        : size(other.size), data(other.data) {
        other.size = 0;
        other.data = nullptr;
        std::cout << "Move constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    // Move assignment operator
    MyVector& operator=(MyVector&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            size = other.size;
            data = other.data;
            other.size = 0;
            other.data = nullptr;
            std::cout << "Move assignment called" << std::endl;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    size_t size;
    int* data;
};

int main() {
    MyVector v1(100);
    MyVector v2(std::move(v1)); // Move constructor
    MyVector v3(200);
    v3 = std::move(v2); // Move assignment operator
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The move constructor `MyVector(MyVector&& other) noexcept` transfers ownership of the resources from the temporary object `other` to the new object being constructed.
- The move assignment operator `MyVector& operator=(MyVector&& other) noexcept` also transfers ownership but first cleans up any existing resources to avoid memory leaks.
- The `std::move` function is used to convert `v1` and `v2` into rvalues, enabling the move operations.

#### Rvalue References

Rvalue references enable the implementation of move semantics. They bind to temporary objects (rvalues) and allow modifications to them. This feature is crucial for move semantics and perfect forwarding.

##### Introduction to Rvalue References

Let's look at how rvalue references work in practice. Continuation from the `MyVector` class, we can extend understanding with manipulated rvalue references.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void processVector(MyVector&& v) {
    std::cout << "Processing vector" << std::endl;
    // `v` is an rvalue reference and can be modified or moved from
}

int main() {
    MyVector v1(100);
    processVector(std::move(v1)); // `v1` is cast to an rvalue reference
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The function `processVector` takes an rvalue reference to `MyVector`. This allows us to either work directly with the temporary object or further forward it.
- `std::move` is used to cast `v1` to an rvalue, making it possible to pass to `processVector`.

#### Perfect Forwarding

Perfect forwarding is about forwarding arguments to another function in such a way that their value categories are preserved. This is particularly useful for generic programming and template functions.

##### Basic Forwarding and Type Deduction

Let's define a simple forwarding function template:

```cpp
#include <utility>
#include <iostream>

class Widget {
public:
    Widget() { std::cout << "Default constructed" << std::endl; }
    Widget(const Widget&) { std::cout << "Copy constructed" << std::endl; }
    Widget(Widget&&) noexcept { std::cout << "Move constructed" << std::endl; }
};

template <typename T>
void makeWidget(T&& arg) {
    Widget w(std::forward<T>(arg));
}

int main() {
    Widget w1;
    makeWidget(w1); // Copy constructor should be called
    makeWidget(std::move(w1)); // Move constructor should be called
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The template function `makeWidget` takes a forwarding reference `T&&`.
- `std::forward<T>(arg)` is used inside the function to pass the argument while preserving its value category, ensuring that `Widget`â€™s copy or move constructor is called appropriately.

##### Advanced Forwarding: Factory Function

Consider a factory function designed to create objects conditionally:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <memory>

template <typename T, typename... Args>
std::unique_ptr<T> createObject(Args&&... args) {
    return std::make_unique<T>(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
}

class Complex {
public:
    Complex(int a, double b) {
        std::cout << "Complex object created with int and double" << std::endl;
    }

    Complex(std::string s) {
        std::cout << "Complex object created with string" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    auto obj1 = createObject<Complex>(42, 3.14);
    auto obj2 = createObject<Complex>("example");
    return 0;
}
```

In this advanced example:

- The `createObject` function template uses variadic templates and perfect forwarding. It takes a parameter pack `Args&&...` and forwards the arguments to `std::make_unique<T>(std::forward<Args>(args)...)`.
- The `Complex` class has overloaded constructors to handle different types of parameters, demonstrating how the forwarded arguments can be used to call the correct constructor.

#### Performance Implications

Understanding the performance implications is critical when applying move semantics, rvalue references, and perfect forwarding.

##### Copy vs. Move

Consider the following scenario to analyze the difference between copying and moving:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>

class LargeObject {
public:
    LargeObject() : data(new int[10000]) {}
    LargeObject(const LargeObject& other) {
        data = new int[10000];
        std::copy(other.data, other.data + 10000, data);
    }
    LargeObject(LargeObject&& other) noexcept : data(other.data) {
        other.data = nullptr;
    }
    ~LargeObject() { delete[] data; }

private:
    int* data;
};

void testCopy() {
    LargeObject a;
    LargeObject b(a);
}

void testMove() {
    LargeObject a;
    LargeObject b(std::move(a));
}

int main() {
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    testCopy();
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::cout << "Copy took: "
              << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start).count()
              << " microseconds" << std::endl;

    start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    testMove();
    end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::cout << "Move took: "
              << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start).count()
              << " microseconds" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We define a `LargeObject` that simulates a heavy resource. The copy constructor performs a deep copy, while the move constructor transfers ownership.
- The `testCopy` and `testMove` functions respectively test copying and moving operations.
- The `main` function measures the execution time for both operations, demonstrating the performance advantage of move semantics over copying.

#### Conclusion

This subchapter has journeyed through critical examples illustrating move semantics, rvalue references, and perfect forwarding. From basic constructs to advanced applications, we examined how these features can optimize performance, enhance code efficiency, and facilitate modern C++ programming paradigms. As you delve into practice with these sample programs, you will build a robust understanding of these essential tools, preparing you to leverage them in your own coding endeavors.

### Exercises for Practice

This subchapter is designed to provide you with a variety of exercises aimed at deepening your understanding of move semantics, rvalue references, and perfect forwarding in C++. These exercises are crafted to cover a spectrum of difficulty levels, allowing you to challenge yourself appropriately. Each exercise is accompanied by a detailed analysis to help reinforce the concepts and ensure you understand the best practices when implementing these features.

#### Exercise 1: Implementing Move Constructor and Move Assignment Operator

**Objective:** Implement a move constructor and a move assignment operator for a custom class.

1. **Class Definition:** Create a class `DynamicArray` that encapsulates a dynamic array of integers.
2. **Constructor and Destructor:** Implement a constructor that accepts the size of the array and dynamically allocates memory. Also, implement a destructor to deallocate memory.
3. **Move Constructor:** Implement a move constructor that transfers ownership of the resource.
4. **Move Assignment Operator:** Implement a move assignment operator that transfers ownership and handles self-assignment correctly.

**Analysis:**

- Ensure that the move constructor properly nullifies the resource in the source object to prevent double deletion.
- Verify that the move assignment operator deallocates any existing resource before transferring the ownership to prevent memory leaks.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility> // For std::move

class DynamicArray {
public:
    DynamicArray(size_t size) : size(size), data(new int[size]) {
        std::cout << "Constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    ~DynamicArray() {
        delete[] data;
        std::cout << "Destructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    // Move constructor
    DynamicArray(DynamicArray&& other) noexcept : size(other.size), data(other.data) {
        other.size = 0;
        other.data = nullptr;
        std::cout << "Move constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    // Move assignment operator
    DynamicArray& operator=(DynamicArray&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            size = other.size;
            data = other.data;
            other.size = 0;
            other.data = nullptr;
            std::cout << "Move assignment called" << std::endl;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    size_t size;
    int* data;
};
```

#### Exercise 2: Perfect Forwarding in a Variadic Function Template

**Objective:** Implement a function template that uses perfect forwarding to forward arguments to another function.

1. **Utility Function:** Create a utility function `logAndCreate` that takes a variety of arguments, logs the parameters, and forwards them to a constructor.
2. **Template Implementation:** Use variadic templates and perfect forwarding to ensure that the value category of the arguments is preserved.
3. **Testing:** Create a class `LoggableObject` with multiple constructors and test the `logAndCreate` function with different sets of arguments.

**Analysis:**

- Ensure the use of `std::forward` to preserve the value category of the arguments.
- Test with both lvalue and rvalue arguments to confirm that the correct constructors are invoked.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

class LoggableObject {
public:
    LoggableObject(int a, double b) {
        std::cout << "LoggableObject created with int and double" << std::endl;
    }

    LoggableObject(std::string s) {
        std::cout << "LoggableObject created with string" << std::endl;
    }
};

template <typename T, typename... Args>
T logAndCreate(Args&&... args) {
    std::cout << "Arguments forwarded: ";
    (std::cout << ... << args) << std::endl;
    return T(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
}

int main() {
    auto obj1 = logAndCreate<LoggableObject>(42, 3.14);
    auto obj2 = logAndCreate<LoggableObject>("example string");
    return 0;
}
```

#### Exercise 3: Optimizing Copy Operations Using Move Semantics

1. **Class Definition:** Create a class `LargeString` that encapsulates a large string dynamically allocated.
2. **Copy Operations:** Implement the copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
3. **Optimization:** Modify the class to include a move constructor and a move assignment operator to optimize the copy operations.

**Analysis:**

- Compare the performance of copy operations before and after implementing move semantics.
- Ensure that the object follows the Rule of Five, implementing destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, and move assignment operator.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <chrono>

class LargeString {
public:

    }

    ~LargeString() {
        delete[] data;
        std::cout << "Destructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    // Copy constructor
    LargeString(const LargeString& other)
        : size(other.size), data(new char[other.size]) {
        std::copy(other.data, other.data + other.size, data);
        std::cout << "Copy constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    // Copy assignment operator
    LargeString& operator=(const LargeString& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            size = other.size;
            data = new char[other.size];
            std::copy(other.data, other.data + other.size, data);
            std::cout << "Copy assignment called" << std::endl;
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Move constructor
    LargeString(LargeString&& other) noexcept
        : size(other.size), data(other.data) {
        other.size = 0;
        other.data = nullptr;
        std::cout << "Move constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    // Move assignment operator
    LargeString& operator=(LargeString&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            size = other.size;
            data = other.data;
            other.size = 0;
            other.data = nullptr;
            std::cout << "Move assignment called" << std::endl;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    size_t size;
    char* data;
};

void testCopy() {
    LargeString str1(1000000);
    LargeString str2(str1);
}

void testMove() {
    LargeString str1(1000000);
    LargeString str2(std::move(str1));
}

int main() {
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    testCopy();
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::cout << "Copy took: "
              << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start).count()
              << " microseconds" << std::endl;

    start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    testMove();
    end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::cout << "Move took: "
              << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start).count()
              << " microseconds" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Exercise 4: Implementing a Custom Container Class Using Move Semantics

**Objective:** Create a custom container class that uses move semantics for efficient resource management.

1. **Class Definition:** Design a class `SimpleVector` that mimics a simplified version of `std::vector`.
2. **Dynamic Memory Management:** Implement constructors, destructor, and methods for dynamic memory management (e.g., `push_back`, `pop_back`).
3. **Move Semantics:** Ensure that the class supports move semantics efficiently by implementing move constructor and move assignment operator.

**Analysis:**

- Focus on handling dynamic memory efficiently without causing memory leaks.
- Test the container class with various types of elements and operations to ensure robustness.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

template <typename T>
class SimpleVector {
public:
    SimpleVector() : size(0), capacity(1), data(new T[1]) {}

    ~SimpleVector() {
        delete[] data;
    }

    // Move constructor
    SimpleVector(SimpleVector&& other) noexcept
        : size(other.size), capacity(other.capacity), data(other.data) {
        other.size = 0;
        other.capacity = 0;
        other.data = nullptr;
    }

    // Move assignment operator
    SimpleVector& operator=(SimpleVector&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            size = other.size;
            capacity = other.capacity;
            data = other.data;
            other.size = 0;
            other.capacity = 0;
            other.data = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

    void push_back(const T& value) {
        if (size == capacity) {
            resize(capacity * 2);
        }
        data[size++] = value;
    }

    void push_back(T&& value) {
        if (size == capacity) {
            resize(capacity * 2);
        }
        data[size++] = std::move(value);
    }

    void pop_back() {
        if (size > 0) {
            --size;
        }
    }

    T& operator[](size_t idx) {
        return data[idx];
    }

    size_t getSize() const {
        return size;
    }

private:
    void resize(size_t newCapacity) {
        T* newData = new T[newCapacity];
        std::move(data, data + size, newData);
        delete[] data;
        data = newData;
        capacity = newCapacity;
    }

    size_t size;
    size_t capacity;
    T* data;
};

int main() {
    SimpleVector<int> vec;
    vec.push_back(1);
    vec.push_back(2);
    vec.push_back(3);

    for (size_t i = 0; i < vec.getSize(); ++i) {
        std::cout << vec[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Exercise 5: Performance Comparison of Copy and Move Semantics

**Objective:** Measure and compare the performance of copy and move operations using large objects.

1. **Class Definition:** Create a class `BigData` that encapsulates a large block of data.
2. **Benchmarking:** Write benchmark functions to measure the time taken for copy and move operations.
3. **Analysis:** Compare the results and analyze the performance benefits of move semantics.

**Analysis:**

- Use high-resolution timers to obtain accurate measurements.
- Perform the operations multiple times to obtain reliable averages and minimize the effect of outliers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <vector>

class BigData {
public:
    BigData(size_t size) : size(size), data(new int[size]) {}

    ~BigData() {
        delete[] data;
    }

    // Copy constructor
    BigData(const BigData& other) : size(other.size), data(new int[other.size]) {
        std::copy(other.data, other.data + other.size, data);
    }

    // Move constructor
    BigData(BigData&& other) noexcept : size(other.size), data(other.data) {
        other.size = 0;
        other.data = nullptr;
    }

    // Copy assignment operator
    BigData& operator=(const BigData& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            size = other.size;
            data = new int[other.size];
            std::copy(other.data, other.data + other.size, data);
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Move assignment operator
    BigData& operator=(BigData&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            size = other.size;
            data = other.data;
            other.size = 0;
            other.data = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    size_t size;
    int* data;
};

void benchmarkCopy() {
    std::vector<BigData> data;
    data.reserve(100);

    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        BigData bd(1000000);
        data.push_back(bd); // Calls copy constructor
    }
}

void benchmarkMove() {
    std::vector<BigData> data;
    data.reserve(100);

    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        BigData bd(1000000);
        data.push_back(std::move(bd)); // Calls move constructor
    }
}

int main() {
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    benchmarkCopy();
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::cout << "Copy benchmark took: "
              << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - start).count()
              << " milliseconds" << std::endl;

    start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    benchmarkMove();
    end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::cout << "Move benchmark took: "
              << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - start).count()
              << " milliseconds" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
