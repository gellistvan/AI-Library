## 17. Move-Only Types

In the journey of mastering C++'s move semantics, the concept of move-only types emerges as a fundamental topic that extends the programmer's ability to optimize and refine resource management. Move-only types, as the name suggests, are entities that can be transferred from one object to another but cannot be duplicated through copy operations. This chapter delves into the intricate process of designing move-only types, exploring their practical use cases, and providing best practices to leverage their full potential. Furthermore, by dissecting common pitfalls, we aim to equip you with the insights needed to avoid errors that can undermine the robustness and efficiency of your code. Whether you're implementing custom resource handlers, working with unique pointers, or developing sophisticated libraries, the principles and techniques discussed in this chapter will be invaluable in enhancing your C++ programming proficiency.

### Designing Move-Only Types

Designing move-only types in C++ warrants a deep understanding of move semantics and the motivations behind restricting copy operations while enabling move operations. This chapter explores the theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and best practices associated with creating and utilizing move-only types in software development.

#### 1. Theoretical Underpinnings

Move semantics were introduced in C++11 as part of the language's effort to optimize resource management and improve performance. Prior to C++11, objects were typically passed by value or by reference, both of which had their own drawbacks in terms of performance:

- **Pass-by-value**: This involves copying the entire object, which can be expensive, especially for objects that hold substantial resources such as dynamic memory, file descriptors, or network connections.
- **Pass-by-reference**: While this avoids copying, it imposes other complications like aliasing issues and the necessity for careful const-correctness and lifetime management.

Move semantics strike a balance by allowing the transfer of resources from one object to another without incurring the cost of deep copying. This is achieved through rvalue references, denoted by `Type&&`, which bind to temporaries and allow for the efficient transfer of resources.

##### Key Concepts:
- **Rvalue References**: These special references can bind to temporary (rvalue) objects and enable their resources to be 'moved'.
- **Move Constructor**: A constructor that transfers resources from an rvalue object to a newly created object.
- **Move Assignment Operator**: An assignment operator that transfers resources from an rvalue object to an existing object.

#### 2. Practical Design Considerations

When designing move-only types, the goal is to ensure that objects of your type can be moved but not copied. This involves several steps:

##### Disabling Copy Operations

To make a type move-only, you need to explicitly disable its copy constructor and copy assignment operator. This can be done by deleting these member functions:

```cpp
class MoveOnlyType {
public:
    MoveOnlyType() = default;
    MoveOnlyType(const MoveOnlyType&) = delete;
    MoveOnlyType& operator=(const MoveOnlyType&) = delete;

    // Move constructor
    MoveOnlyType(MoveOnlyType&& other) noexcept {
        // Transfer resources from `other` to `this`
    }

    // Move assignment operator
    MoveOnlyType& operator=(MoveOnlyType&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            // Release current resources and transfer resources from `other` to `this`
        }
        return *this;
    }

    ~MoveOnlyType() {
        // Clean up resources
    }

private:
    // Resource managed by the type
};
```

##### Implementing Move Constructor

The move constructor should efficiently transfer ownership of resources from the source object (`other`) to the newly created object (`this`). As the source object is an rvalue, its resources can be safely 'stolen'. Example considerations include:

- Transfer ownership pointers.
- Reset or nullify the source object’s pointers to avoid double deletion.
- Perform shallow copy of lightweight attributes.

##### Implementing Move Assignment Operator

The move assignment operator is more complex than the move constructor since it needs to deal with releasing existing resources before acquiring new ones from the source object. Here are the steps:

- Self-assignment check.
- Release or clean up any existing resources in the target object.
- Transfer ownership from the source object.
- Nullify or reset the source object’s pointers and state.

##### Handling Resource Management Safely

When designing move-only types, it's crucial to ensure that resource management is robust to avoid leaks and undefined behavior. Key aspects include:

- **Rule of Five**: When providing custom implementations for any of the destructor, copy/move constructors, or copy/move assignment operators, typically all five need explicit handling to avoid issues.
- **Exception Safety**: Ensuring that move operations are marked `noexcept` where possible, which can be vital for optimization, particularly with container operations (std::vector relies on this).

```cpp
MoveOnlyType(MoveOnlyType&& other) noexcept {
    // Implementation details
}

MoveOnlyType& operator=(MoveOnlyType&& other) noexcept {
    // Implementation details
    return *this;
}
```

#### 3. Use Cases and Best Practices

Move-only types find their use in scenarios where resource exclusivity is paramount. Some common use cases include:

- **Unique Ownership**: `std::unique_ptr` is the epitome of move-only types, used for exclusive ownership of dynamically allocated objects, ensuring single ownership semantics.
- **File Handles and Sockets**: Wrapping OS-level resources to ensure exclusive ownership and automatic clean-up when the enclosing object goes out of scope.
- **Scoped Guards**: Ensuring non-copyable but moveable resource managers like lock guards or file descriptors.

##### Examples and Patterns

- **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)**: Encapsulating resource management in a move-only type ensures deterministic cleanup and exceptional safety.
  
```cpp
class FileHandle {
public:
    FileHandle(const char* filename) {
        handle_ = open(filename, O_RDONLY);
    }
    ~FileHandle() {
        if (handle_ != -1) {
            close(handle_);
        }
    }
    FileHandle(const FileHandle&) = delete;
    FileHandle& operator=(const FileHandle&) = delete;
    FileHandle(FileHandle&& other) noexcept : handle_(other.handle_) {
        other.handle_ = -1;
    }
    FileHandle& operator=(FileHandle&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            if (handle_ != -1) {
                close(handle_);
            }
            handle_ = other.handle_;
            other.handle_ = -1;
        }
        return *this;
    }
  
private:
    int handle_ = -1;
};
```

- **Transfer of Ownership**: Move-only types are employed to clearly express transfer semantics, avoiding ambiguities and unintentional resource sharing.

#### 4. Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Despite the utility of move-only types, several pitfalls can lead to subtle bugs or inefficient implementations:

##### Accidental Copies

Ensure that all copying mechanisms are explicitly deleted and no default behavior is inadvertently reintroduced.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() = default;
    MyClass(const MyClass&) = delete;
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass&) = delete;
    MyClass(MyClass&&) = default;
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&&) = default;
};
```

##### Dangling References and Double Deletion

Caution is warranted to prevent move operations that leave dangling pointers or fail to nullify moved-from objects, leading to double deletion or undefined behavior.

##### Exception Safety

Move-only types should handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring that partially moved objects don't leak resources or leave the program in an inconsistent state.

#### Summary:
In conclusion, move-only types are a powerful construct within C++ that, when designed correctly, afford significant benefits in resource management and performance optimization. By adhering to best practices and being conscious of potential pitfalls, you can design robust move-only types that will enhance your software’s efficiency and reliability.

### Use Cases and Best Practices

Move-only types represent a powerful paradigm in modern C++ programming, allowing developers to manage resources efficiently and safely. Understanding their use cases and the best practices for implementing them is crucial to harnessing their full potential. This chapter delves into various practical applications where move-only types excel, explores best design practices to ensure robust and efficient implementations, and discusses advanced considerations to facilitate optimal usability and performance.

#### Essential Use Cases for Move-Only Types

Move-only types are employed in various scenarios where exclusive ownership of resources is desirable. Here, we discuss several key use cases, which highlight the necessity and utility of move-only semantics.

##### 1. Unique Ownership of Dynamic Resources

One of the most prominent use cases for move-only types is managing unique ownership of dynamically allocated resources. The `std::unique_ptr` in the C++ Standard Library is an archetypal example:

- **Exclusive Ownership**: A `std::unique_ptr` ensures that at most one pointer manages a given dynamically allocated object. This eliminates the ambiguity and potential hazards associated with shared ownership.
- **Automatic Deallocation**: When the owning `std::unique_ptr` goes out of scope, the managed resource is automatically deallocated, thus preventing memory leaks.

##### Motivation and Example

Dynamic resource management is essential in scenarios involving large objects, complex data structures, or resources that are expensive to initialize. Example use cases include managing graphics resources (e.g., textures, shaders), file handles, network connections, and database connections.

Consider a scenario wherein you need to manage a complex data structure like a tree, where nodes are dynamically allocated:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int value;
    std::unique_ptr<Node> left;
    std::unique_ptr<Node> right;
    
    Node(int val) : value(val) {}
};

// Function to create a new node
std::unique_ptr<Node> createNode(int value) {
    return std::make_unique<Node>(value);
}
```

In this example, `std::unique_ptr` ensures that each `Node` has exclusive ownership of its child nodes, enforcing the tree’s structural integrity and preventing memory leaks.

##### 2. Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)

Move-only types serve as a perfect vehicle for implementing RAII, a programming idiom that ties resource management to object lifespan. When a resource—is acquired during object construction and released in the destructor, exceptions and early returns become safe, as resources are deterministically cleaned up.

```cpp
class ScopedFile {
public:
    explicit ScopedFile(const std::string& filename) {
        file_ = fopen(filename.c_str(), "r");
        if (!file_) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to open file");
        }
    }

    ~ScopedFile() {
        if (file_) {
            fclose(file_);
        }
    }

    ScopedFile(const ScopedFile&) = delete;
    ScopedFile& operator=(const ScopedFile&) = delete;
    ScopedFile(ScopedFile&& other) noexcept : file_(other.file_) {
        other.file_ = nullptr;
    }
    ScopedFile& operator=(ScopedFile&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            if (file_) {
                fclose(file_);
            }
            file_ = other.file_;
            other.file_ = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    FILE* file_ = nullptr;
};
```

In this example, `ScopedFile` demonstrates RAII by ensuring that a file is closed automatically when the `ScopedFile` object goes out of scope, regardless of how the scope is exited.

##### 3. Implementing Move-Only Containers

Containers, such as custom implementations of arrays, lists, or hash maps, can benefit significantly from move semantics, particularly when internal elements themselves are move-only:

```cpp
template<typename T>
class MoveOnlyContainer {
public:
    void add(T&& element) {
        elements_.emplace_back(std::move(element));
    }

    // Other container operations
private:
    std::vector<T> elements_;
};
```

This structure enables the container to manage elements that cannot be copied, thus allowing greater flexibility and ensuring optimal performance by utilizing move semantics.

##### 4. Synchronization Primitives and Scoped Guards

Move-only types can encapsulate synchronization primitives, ensuring that these resources are correctly managed:

```cpp
class ScopedLock {
public:
    explicit ScopedLock(std::mutex& mutex) : mutex_(mutex) {
        mutex_.lock();
    }

    ~ScopedLock() {
        mutex_.unlock();
    }

    ScopedLock(const ScopedLock&) = delete;
    ScopedLock& operator=(const ScopedLock&) = delete;
    ScopedLock(ScopedLock&&) = delete;
    ScopedLock& operator=(ScopedLock&&) = delete;

private:
    std::mutex& mutex_;
};
```

`ScopedLock` ensures that a mutex is automatically released when the `ScopedLock` object is destroyed, providing strong exception safety and preventing deadlocks.

#### Best Practices for Designing Move-Only Types

To effectively utilize move-only types, certain design principles and practices should be followed to ensure correctness, safety, and efficiency.

##### Enforcing Non-Copyability

Explicitly deleting the copy constructor and copy assignment operator is essential to enforce non-copyability:

```cpp
class MyMoveOnlyType {
public:
    MyMoveOnlyType() = default;
    MyMoveOnlyType(const MyMoveOnlyType&) = delete;
    MyMoveOnlyType& operator=(const MyMoveOnlyType&) = delete;
};
```

##### Providing Efficient Move Operations

Ensure that the move constructor and move assignment operator are implemented efficiently. Moving should involve transferring ownership of resources without deep copying.

- **Move Constructor**: Transfer resources and invalidate the source object’s pointers or state.
- **Move Assignment Operator**: Handle self-assignment, release current resources, and transfer resources from the source.

Mark these operations `noexcept` to enable optimal performance, particularly with standard containers:

```cpp
MyMoveOnlyType::MyMoveOnlyType(MyMoveOnlyType&& other) noexcept {
    resource_ = other.resource_;
    other.resource_ = nullptr;
}

MyMoveOnlyType& MyMoveOnlyType::operator=(MyMoveOnlyType&& other) noexcept {
    if (this != &other) {
        delete resource_;
        resource_ = other.resource_;
        other.resource_ = nullptr;
    }
    return *this;
}
```

##### Ensuring Strong Exception Safety

Operate under the principle that operations should either complete entirely or have no effect. Move constructors and assignment operators should leave the object in a valid state even if an exception occurs.

```cpp
class MyExceptionSafeType {
public:
    MyExceptionSafeType() = default;
    MyExceptionSafeType(MyExceptionSafeType&& other) noexcept {
        resource_ = other.resource_;
        other.resource_ = nullptr;
    }

    MyExceptionSafeType& operator=(MyExceptionSafeType&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            MyExceptionSafeType temp(std::move(other));
            std::swap(resource_, temp.resource_);
        }
        return *this;
    }
private:
    Resource* resource_ = nullptr;
};
```

##### Minimizing Dependence on External Resources

Move-only types that encapsulate external resources, such as file descriptors or network sockets, should handle these resources carefully to prevent leaks and ensure that resources are properly released.

##### Clear Ownership Semantics

Design move-only types to clearly convey ownership semantics—whether the resource ownership is transferred or shared. This aids in avoiding logical errors and improves code readability.

#### Conclusion

Understanding and correctly implementing move-only types in C++ provides a robust mechanism for resource management, ensuring efficient utilization and avoiding common pitfalls associated with deep copying. By adhering to the best practices discussed in this chapter, you can build more reliable, efficient, and maintainable software that leverages the full power of move semantics. Use cases such as unique ownership, RAII, move-only containers, and scoped guards exemplify how move-only types can be applied to solve real-world problems elegantly and efficiently.

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Designing and using move-only types in C++ can provide numerous benefits, particularly concerning performance and resource management. However, the complexity involved also presents a variety of pitfalls that developers must avoid to ensure robust and efficient code. This chapter delves deeply into common pitfalls encountered when working with move-only types and provides strategies to address them.

#### 1. Unintentional Copies

A prevalent pitfall is inadvertently allowing copies of objects that should be move-only. Since C++ will implicitly generate copy constructors and copy assignment operators if they are not explicitly deleted, this can lead to subtle bugs.

##### Example of Unintentional Copies

Consider a class that manages a dynamically allocated resource:

```cpp
class Resource {
public:
    Resource() { data = new int[100]; }
    ~Resource() { delete[] data; }

private:
    int* data;
};
```

Without explicitly deleting the copy constructor and copy assignment operator, the class permits copying, which can lead to double-free errors or memory corruption.

```cpp
class Resource {
public:
    Resource() { data = new int[100]; }
    ~Resource() { delete[] data; }

    // Disable copying
    Resource(const Resource&) = delete;
    Resource& operator=(const Resource&) = delete;
    
    // Enable moving
    Resource(Resource&& other) noexcept {
        data = other.data;
        other.data = nullptr;
    }

    Resource& operator=(Resource&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            data = other.data;
            other.data = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    int* data = nullptr;
};
```

#### 2. Dangling References and Pointers

Another critical pitfall is the creation of dangling references or pointers. When an object is moved, the original object is left in an indeterminate state, which can lead to using invalid references or pointers.

##### Avoiding Dangling References

Post-move, ensure that the moved-from object is left in a safe, clean, and destructible state. Consider nullifying pointers and setting values that indicate the object's empty state.

```cpp
class SafeResource {
public:
    SafeResource() { data = new int[100]; }
    ~SafeResource() { delete data; }

    SafeResource(SafeResource&& other) noexcept : data(other.data) {
        other.data = nullptr;  // Nullify the moved-from object
    }

    SafeResource& operator=(SafeResource&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete data;
            data = other.data;
            other.data = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    int* data = nullptr;
};
```

#### 3. Exception Safety

Exception safety is a paramount concern when dealing with move-only types. Move constructors and assignment operators should ensure that resources are not leaked and invariants are maintained, even in the presence of exceptions.

##### Ensuring Exception Safety

Mark move operations as `noexcept` to guarantee their exception safety. This ensures that standard library containers can rely on these types, optimizing their performance and correctness.

```cpp
class MySafeType {
public:
    MySafeType() = default;

    MySafeType(MySafeType&& other) noexcept : data(other.data) {
        other.data = nullptr;
    }

    MySafeType& operator=(MySafeType&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            MySafeType temp(std::move(other)); // Ensure strong exception safety
            std::swap(data, temp.data);
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    int* data = nullptr;
};
```

By temporarily moving data into a local object and using `std::swap`, this ensures that any operations are either complete or have no effect, providing strong exception safety.

#### 4. Self-Assignment Issues

In the context of move assignment operators, self-assignment is an edge case that must be handled explicitly to avoid undefined behavior or resource leaks.

##### Handling Self-Assignment

Always check for self-assignment, particularly in move assignment operators. Failure to do so can lead to scenarios where objects inadvertently invalidate their own state.

```cpp
class SelfAssignmentSafeType {
public:
    SelfAssignmentSafeType() = default;

    SelfAssignmentSafeType& operator=(SelfAssignmentSafeType&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            // Perform the move operation
            data = other.data;
            other.data = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    int* data = nullptr;
};
```

#### 5. Incorrect Resource Management

Move-only types often manage resources directly, such as memory, file handles, sockets, or custom resources. Incorrect management of these resources can lead to leaks, deadlocks, or other forms of undefined behavior.

##### Proper Resource Management

Ensure resources are correctly managed by implementing the Rule of Five: destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, and move assignment operator. Follow RAII principles to tie resource lifespan to object scope.

```cpp
class ManagedResource {
public:
    ManagedResource() : handle(openResource()) {}
    ~ManagedResource() { closeResource(handle); }

    ManagedResource(const ManagedResource&) = delete;
    ManagedResource& operator=(const ManagedResource&) = delete;

    ManagedResource(ManagedResource&& other) noexcept : handle(other.handle) {
        other.handle = nullptr;
    }

    ManagedResource& operator=(ManagedResource&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            closeResource(handle);
            handle = other.handle;
            other.handle = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    ResourceHandle handle;

    ResourceHandle openResource() { /* ... */ }
    void closeResource(ResourceHandle handle) { /* ... */ }
};
```

#### 6. Potential Performance Issues

While move operations are generally more efficient than copies, improper design can still lead to performance bottlenecks. Unnecessary allocations or deallocations, excessive resource management operations, or needless complexity can degrade performance.

##### Maximizing Performance

- **Minimize Resource Allocation/De-allocation**: Design move-only types to avoid unnecessary allocations and deallocations.
- **Use `noexcept`**: Mark move constructors and assignment operators `noexcept` to enable optimizations in standard containers.
- **Efficient Resource Transfer**: Ensure resources are transferred with minimal overhead, and utilize efficient algorithms for handling resources.

```cpp
class EfficientType {
public:
    EfficientType() = default;
    EfficientType(EfficientType&& other) noexcept : resource(other.resource) {
        other.resource = nullptr;
    }

    EfficientType& operator=(EfficientType&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            std::swap(resource, other.resource); // Efficient resource transfer
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    Resource* resource = nullptr;
};
```

#### 7. Overcomplicating Move Logic

Advanced move logic, such as deep hierarchies or complex resource dependencies, can lead to overcomplicated implementations that are hard to understand, maintain, and debug.

##### Simplifying Move Logic

Adopt clear, simple patterns for implementing move semantics. Avoid unnecessary dependencies and strive for straightforward, readable code that colleagues and future maintainers can easily understand.

```cpp
class SimpleMoveOnlyType {
public:
    SimpleMoveOnlyType() : resource(new Resource()) {}
    ~SimpleMoveOnlyType() { delete resource; }

    SimpleMoveOnlyType(SimpleMoveOnlyType&& other) noexcept : resource(other.resource) {
        other.resource = nullptr;
    }

    SimpleMoveOnlyType& operator=(SimpleMoveOnlyType&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete resource;
            resource = other.resource;
            other.resource = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    Resource* resource = nullptr;
};
```

#### Summary

The intricacies of move-only types require careful consideration to avoid common pitfalls effectively. Unintentional copies, dangling references, exception safety issues, self-assignment mishandling, incorrect resource management, potential performance problems, and overcomplication of move logic are all hazards that can undermine the benefits of move semantics. By explicitly disabling copy operations, ensuring exception safety, correctly handling resources, and adopting simplified, efficient designs, developers can leverage move-only types to create robust, performant, and maintainable software.
