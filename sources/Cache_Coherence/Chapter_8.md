### 8.1 Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) Considerations

Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architectures present unique challenges and opportunities for optimizing memory access patterns in multithreaded applications. Understanding NUMA considerations is crucial for developing high-performance software that fully leverages modern multi-core processors. This section explores the principles of NUMA, the performance implications, and strategies for optimizing NUMA systems, with detailed examples to illustrate these concepts.

#### **8.1.1 Understanding NUMA Architectures**

NUMA architectures differ from Uniform Memory Access (UMA) architectures by having multiple memory nodes, each associated with a specific group of CPUs. Accessing memory within the same node is faster than accessing memory across nodes. This disparity in memory access times is the core characteristic of NUMA systems.

- **NUMA Nodes**: Each node consists of a CPU and a local memory. Nodes are connected via high-speed interconnects.
- **Local vs. Remote Memory Access**: Accessing local memory is faster (lower latency and higher bandwidth) compared to accessing remote memory across nodes.

- **Example**: Consider a system with two NUMA nodes. If a CPU in Node 1 accesses memory in Node 2, it will experience higher latency compared to accessing its local memory in Node 1.

#### **8.1.2 Performance Implications of NUMA**

NUMA architectures can significantly impact the performance of multithreaded applications. Poorly optimized memory access patterns can lead to increased latency and reduced throughput due to frequent remote memory accesses.

- **Example**: In a database application running on a NUMA system, if threads on Node 1 frequently access data stored in Node 2, the application will experience higher latency and lower performance compared to a scenario where each thread accesses local data.

#### **8.1.3 Strategies for Optimizing NUMA Systems**

Optimizing applications for NUMA involves several strategies to minimize remote memory accesses and improve data locality.

##### **1. NUMA-Aware Memory Allocation**

Allocate memory close to the CPU that will access it most frequently. Many operating systems provide NUMA-aware memory allocation functions.

- **Example**: Using `numa_alloc_onnode` in Linux to allocate memory on a specific NUMA node.

    ```cpp
    #include <numa.h>
    #include <iostream>

    void* allocateLocalMemory(size_t size, int node) {
        void* ptr = numa_alloc_onnode(size, node);
        if (ptr == nullptr) {
            std::cerr << "NUMA allocation failed!" << std::endl;
            exit(1);
        }
        return ptr;
    }

    int main() {
        int node = 0;
        size_t size = 1024 * 1024; // 1 MB
        void* memory = allocateLocalMemory(size, node);
        // Use the memory...
        numa_free(memory, size);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

##### **2. Thread and Memory Affinity**

Bind threads to specific CPUs and allocate memory close to those CPUs to ensure that each thread primarily accesses local memory.

- **Example**: Using `pthread_setaffinity_np` to set thread affinity in Linux.

    ```cpp
    #include <pthread.h>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <numa.h>
    #include <vector>

    void* allocateLocalMemory(size_t size, int node) {
        void* ptr = numa_alloc_onnode(size, node);
        if (ptr == nullptr) {
            std::cerr << "NUMA allocation failed!" << std::endl;
            exit(1);
        }
        return ptr;
    }

    void setThreadAffinity(int cpu) {
        cpu_set_t cpuset;
        CPU_ZERO(&cpuset);
        CPU_SET(cpu, &cpuset);

        if (pthread_setaffinity_np(pthread_self(), sizeof(cpu_set_t), &cpuset) != 0) {
            std::cerr << "Failed to set thread affinity!" << std::endl;
        }
    }

    void* threadFunction(void* arg) {
        int cpu = *((int*)arg);
        setThreadAffinity(cpu);
        int node = numa_node_of_cpu(cpu);
        size_t size = 1024 * 1024; // 1 MB
        void* memory = allocateLocalMemory(size, node);
        // Perform operations on memory...
        numa_free(memory, size);
        return nullptr;
    }

    int main() {
        const int numThreads = 4;
        pthread_t threads[numThreads];
        std::vector<int> cpus = {0, 1, 2, 3}; // Assume 4 CPUs for simplicity

        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
            pthread_create(&threads[i], nullptr, threadFunction, &cpus[i]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
            pthread_join(threads[i], nullptr);
        }

        return 0;
    }
    ```

##### **3. NUMA Balancing**

Use NUMA balancing features provided by the operating system to automatically migrate pages to the local node of the accessing CPU.

- **Example**: Enabling automatic NUMA balancing in Linux.

    ```sh
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing
    ```

##### **4. Data Partitioning**

Partition data such that each NUMA node processes its local data, reducing the need for remote memory accesses.

- **Example**: Partitioning a dataset for parallel processing.

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>
    #include <thread>

    void processData(std::vector<int>& data, int start, int end) {
        for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
            data[i] *= 2; // Example processing.
        }
    }

    int main() {
        const int dataSize = 100000;
        std::vector<int> data(dataSize, 1);

        int numThreads = 4;
        int chunkSize = dataSize / numThreads;
        std::vector<std::thread> threads;

        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
            int start = i * chunkSize;
            int end = (i == numThreads - 1) ? dataSize : start + chunkSize;
            threads.emplace_back(processData, std::ref(data), start, end);
        }

        for (auto& t : threads) {
            t.join();
        }

        // Output results
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            std::cout << data[i] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }
    ```

##### **5. Performance Monitoring**

Regularly profile and monitor the performance of NUMA systems to identify and address bottlenecks.

- **Example**: Using `numastat` to monitor NUMA statistics.

    ```sh
    numastat -c 1
    ```

#### **8.1.4 Real-Life Example: Optimizing a High-Performance Computing Application**

A high-performance computing (HPC) application simulating weather patterns was experiencing suboptimal performance on a NUMA system. Profiling revealed that memory access patterns were not NUMA-aware, leading to frequent remote memory accesses and high latency.

##### **Initial Investigation**

1. **Symptoms**: High latency, low throughput.
2. **Profiling Tool**: Intel VTune Profiler and `numactl`.
3. **Findings**: Significant remote memory accesses in the core simulation function.

##### **Profiling Analysis**

Using Intel VTune Profiler, the team identified that the `simulateWeather` function had a high number of remote memory accesses. Further analysis with `numactl` confirmed that memory was not being allocated optimally for NUMA.

```cpp
void simulateWeather(std::vector<std::vector<double>>& grid) {
    int gridSize = grid.size();
    for (int i = 1; i < gridSize - 1; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j < gridSize - 1; ++j) {
            grid[i][j] = 0.25 * (grid[i-1][j] + grid[i+1][j] + grid[i][j-1] + grid[i][j+1]); // High remote memory access.
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Optimization**

The team applied NUMA-aware memory allocation and data partitioning to ensure that each thread accessed local memory.

```cpp
#include <numa.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>

void* allocateLocalMemory(size_t size, int node) {
    void* ptr = numa_alloc_onnode(size, node);
    if (ptr == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "NUMA allocation failed!" << std::endl;
        exit(1);
    }
    return ptr;
}

void simulateWeather(double* grid, int gridSize, int start, int end) {
    for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j < gridSize - 1; ++j) {
            grid[i * gridSize + j] = 0.25 * (grid[(i-1) * gridSize + j] + grid[(i+1) * gridSize + j] + grid[i * gridSize + (j-1)] + grid[i * gridSize + (j+1)]); // Optimized for NUMA.
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int gridSize = 1000;
    int num

Nodes = numa_num_configured_nodes();
    int numThreads = 4;
    int chunkSize = gridSize / numThreads;

    // Allocate memory for the grid
    double* grid = (double*)allocateLocalMemory(gridSize * gridSize * sizeof(double), 0);

    // Initialize grid with some values
    for (int i = 0; i < gridSize; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < gridSize; ++j) {
            grid[i * gridSize + j] = 1.0;
        }
    }

    // Create and launch threads
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
        int start = i * chunkSize;
        int end = (i == numThreads - 1) ? gridSize : start + chunkSize;
        threads.emplace_back(simulateWeather, grid, gridSize, start, end);
    }

    for (auto& t : threads) {
        t.join();
    }

    // Output some results
    std::cout << "Grid[0][0] = " << grid[0 * gridSize + 0] << std::endl;
    numa_free(grid, gridSize * gridSize * sizeof(double));

    return 0;
}
```

##### **Outcome**

1. **Results**: Remote memory accesses were reduced by 50%, and overall simulation performance improved by 35%.
2. **Conclusion**: Applying NUMA-aware memory allocation and data partitioning can significantly enhance performance by reducing remote memory accesses and improving data locality.

#### **Conclusion**

NUMA architectures present unique challenges and opportunities for optimizing memory access patterns in multithreaded applications. By understanding the principles of NUMA, identifying performance implications, and employing strategies such as NUMA-aware memory allocation, thread and memory affinity, data partitioning, and performance monitoring, developers can significantly improve the performance of their applications. The case studies provided demonstrate practical approaches to addressing NUMA-related performance issues, offering valuable insights for optimizing NUMA systems. The following sections will continue to explore advanced topics in cache coherence, providing a comprehensive guide to mastering performance optimization in C++.

### 8.2 Hardware Transactional Memory and Its Impact on Cache Coherence

Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) is a promising technology that aims to simplify concurrent programming by enabling atomic execution of code blocks without the need for traditional locks. HTM can significantly impact cache coherence and overall performance in multithreaded applications. This section explores the principles of HTM, its impact on cache coherence, and practical examples to illustrate its use.

#### **8.2.1 Understanding Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM)**

HTM allows blocks of code to execute in a transaction, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties without explicit locking. If a transaction completes successfully, changes are committed atomically; otherwise, the transaction is aborted, and any changes are discarded.

##### **Key Concepts of HTM**

- **Transaction**: A sequence of instructions executed atomically.
- **Commit**: Successfully completing a transaction and applying changes atomically.
- **Abort**: Terminating a transaction without applying changes, typically due to conflicts or resource limitations.
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifying when multiple transactions attempt to access the same data simultaneously, leading to potential conflicts.

- **Example**: In a financial application, updating multiple account balances atomically ensures that either all changes are applied or none, maintaining consistency.

#### **8.2.2 HTM and Cache Coherence**

HTM relies on the underlying cache coherence protocol to manage transactional data. When a transaction reads or writes data, the relevant cache lines are monitored for conflicts. HTM impacts cache coherence in several ways:

- **Cache Line Locking**: During a transaction, cache lines accessed by the transaction are locked to detect conflicts.
- **Conflict Detection**: If another transaction or thread accesses a locked cache line, a conflict is detected, potentially aborting the transaction.
- **Cache Line Invalidation**: Invalidate cache lines modified by aborted transactions to maintain consistency.

- **Example**: In a banking application, multiple transactions updating the same account balance would be detected as conflicts, causing one of the transactions to abort.

#### **8.2.3 Practical Use of HTM**

HTM simplifies concurrent programming by reducing the need for explicit locks. However, it requires careful management to handle transaction aborts and ensure optimal performance.

##### **Using HTM in C++**

Intel's Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) is an example of HTM support available in modern CPUs. Intel TSX provides two interfaces: Hardware Lock Elision (HLE) and Restricted Transactional Memory (RTM).

- **Example**: Using RTM in C++ with Intel TSX.

    ```cpp
    #include <immintrin.h>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <thread>
    #include <vector>

    std::vector<int> sharedData(100, 0);
    std::mutex mtx;

    void updateData(int start, int end) {
        while (true) {
            unsigned status = _xbegin();
            if (status == _XBEGIN_STARTED) {
                for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
                    sharedData[i] += 1;
                }
                _xend();
                break;
            } else {
                // Fallback to mutex if transaction fails
                std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
            }
        }
    }

    int main() {
        const int numThreads = 4;
        const int chunkSize = sharedData.size() / numThreads;
        std::vector<std::thread> threads;

        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
            int start = i * chunkSize;
            int end = (i == numThreads - 1) ? sharedData.size() : start + chunkSize;
            threads.emplace_back(updateData, start, end);
        }

        for (auto& t : threads) {
            t.join();
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            std::cout << sharedData[i] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }
    ```

  In this example, the `updateData` function attempts to execute a transaction using `_xbegin` and `_xend`. If the transaction fails, it falls back to using a mutex for synchronization.

##### **Handling Transaction Aborts**

Transactions can abort for various reasons, including conflicts, resource limitations, or explicit aborts. Handling aborts involves retrying transactions or falling back to traditional synchronization mechanisms.

- **Example**: Handling transaction aborts with retries.

    ```cpp
    void updateData(int start, int end) {
        int retries = 5;
        while (retries-- > 0) {
            unsigned status = _xbegin();
            if (status == _XBEGIN_STARTED) {
                for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
                    sharedData[i] += 1;
                }
                _xend();
                return;
            } else if (status & _XABORT_RETRY) {
                // Retry the transaction
                continue;
            } else {
                // Fallback to mutex if transaction fails
                std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
                break;
            }
        }

        // Perform the update with mutex as a fallback
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
            sharedData[i] += 1;
        }
    }
    ```

#### **8.2.4 Real-Life Example: Optimizing a Concurrent Data Structure**

Consider a real-life scenario where an application uses a concurrent hash map. Traditional locking mechanisms can lead to high contention and poor performance. Using HTM can improve performance by reducing lock contention.

##### **Initial Code with Traditional Locking**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

std::unordered_map<int, int> hashMap;
std::mutex mtx;

void insertData(int key, int value) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    hashMap[key] = value;
}

int main() {
    const int numThreads = 4;
    const int numInserts = 10000;
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back([i, numInserts]() {
            for (int j = 0; j < numInserts; ++j) {
                insertData(i * numInserts + j, j);
            }
        });
    }

    for (auto& t : threads) {
        t.join();
    }

    std::cout << "Final size of hashMap: " << hashMap.size() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

##### **Optimized Code with HTM**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
#include <immintrin.h>

std::unordered_map<int, int> hashMap;
std::mutex mtx;

void insertData(int key, int value) {
    int retries = 5;
    while (retries-- > 0) {
        unsigned status = _xbegin();
        if (status == _XBEGIN_STARTED) {
            hashMap[key] = value;
            _xend();
            return;
        } else if (status & _XABORT_RETRY) {
            continue; // Retry the transaction
        } else {
            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
            break;
        }
    }

    // Perform the insert with mutex as a fallback
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    hashMap[key] = value;
}

int main() {
    const int numThreads = 4;
    const int numInserts = 10000;
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back([i, numInserts]() {
            for (int j = 0; j < numInserts; ++j) {
                insertData(i * numInserts + j, j);
            }
        });
    }

    for (auto& t : threads) {
        t.join();
    }

    std::cout << "Final size of hashMap: " << hashMap.size() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, HTM is used to reduce lock contention when inserting data into the hash map. If a transaction fails, it retries or falls back to using a mutex for synchronization.

##### **Outcome**

1. **Results**: The HTM-optimized version showed a significant reduction in lock contention and improved throughput.
2. **Conclusion**: Using HTM can enhance performance in concurrent data structures by reducing lock contention and leveraging transactional memory for atomic updates.

#### **8.2.5 Conclusion**

Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) offers a powerful mechanism for simplifying concurrent programming and improving performance by reducing the need for explicit locks. By understanding the principles of HTM, managing transaction aborts, and optimizing data structures, developers can leverage HTM to enhance cache coherence and overall system performance. The provided examples demonstrate practical approaches to using HTM in real-world applications, offering valuable insights for optimizing multithreaded programs. The following sections will continue to explore advanced topics in cache coherence, providing a comprehensive guide to mastering performance optimization in C++.



### 8.3 Future Trends in Cache Coherence Technologies

The evolution of cache coherence technologies continues to shape the landscape of computing, particularly as the demand for higher performance and greater efficiency grows. Future trends in cache coherence are driven by the need to support increasingly complex and diverse workloads on multi-core and many-core processors. This section explores emerging trends and innovations in cache coherence technologies, with detailed explanations and real-life examples to illustrate their potential impact.

#### **8.3.1 Increasing Core Counts and Heterogeneous Architectures**

As processors continue to evolve, the number of cores per chip increases, and heterogeneous architectures become more prevalent. These trends pose significant challenges for maintaining efficient cache coherence.

- **Example**: Modern GPUs and accelerators, such as those used in artificial intelligence and machine learning, have thousands of cores that need efficient data sharing mechanisms.

##### **Challenges**

1. **Scalability**: Traditional cache coherence protocols like MESI and MOESI struggle to scale efficiently with increasing core counts.
2. **Heterogeneity**: Different types of cores (e.g., CPU, GPU, DSP) have varying memory access patterns and coherence requirements, complicating coherence management.

##### **Solutions**

1. **Directory-Based Coherence**: Directory-based protocols store coherence information in a centralized directory, reducing the overhead of broadcasting invalidation messages to all cores.

    - **Example**: A directory-based protocol can efficiently manage coherence for a 128-core processor by keeping track of which cores have cached copies of a memory block, thus reducing unnecessary invalidations.

2. **Hierarchical Coherence**: Hierarchical coherence protocols organize cores into clusters, with coherence maintained at both the cluster level and the global level.

    - **Example**: In a 256-core processor, hierarchical coherence can group cores into clusters of 16, each managed by a local directory, while a global directory oversees inter-cluster coherence.

#### **8.3.2 Software-Defined Coherence**

Software-defined coherence (SDC) is an emerging trend where software, rather than hardware, manages cache coherence. This approach provides greater flexibility and can be tailored to specific applications and workloads.

##### **Advantages**

1. **Customizability**: Developers can design coherence protocols optimized for their specific workloads.
2. **Adaptability**: Coherence strategies can be dynamically adjusted based on runtime conditions and workload characteristics.

- **Example**: In cloud computing environments, different VMs may have varying coherence requirements. SDC allows each VM to use a tailored coherence protocol, optimizing performance and resource utilization.

##### **Implementation**

SDC requires support from both hardware and software. Hardware must provide basic mechanisms for invalidation and update, while software handles the higher-level protocol logic.

- **Example**: A data analytics application running on a cloud platform might use SDC to ensure that frequently accessed data is kept coherent across nodes with minimal overhead, improving query performance.

#### **8.3.3 Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and Cache Coherence**

Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies, such as Intel Optane, offer persistent storage with near-DRAM performance. Integrating NVM into the memory hierarchy introduces new challenges and opportunities for cache coherence.

##### **Challenges**

1. **Persistence**: Ensuring data remains coherent across both volatile and non-volatile memory.
2. **Performance**: Balancing the need for persistence with the high-speed requirements of cache coherence.

##### **Solutions**

1. **Hybrid Memory Systems**: Combining DRAM and NVM in a unified memory system, with coherence mechanisms adapted to handle both types of memory.

    - **Example**: A hybrid memory system might use DRAM for frequently accessed data while leveraging NVM for large, persistent datasets. Cache coherence protocols ensure that updates to NVM are properly managed to maintain consistency.

2. **Persistent Cache Coherence**: Developing coherence protocols specifically designed for NVM, addressing issues such as write endurance and latency.
