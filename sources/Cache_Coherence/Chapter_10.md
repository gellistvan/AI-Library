## Chapter 10: The Project: Developing a Cache-Friendly Application

### 10.1 Project Overview and Objectives

In this chapter, we embark on a comprehensive project aimed at developing a cache-friendly application. The project will highlight the importance of optimizing data structures, memory access patterns, and concurrency mechanisms to enhance cache utilization and overall performance. By the end of this project, you will have a clear understanding of how to apply cache-friendly techniques in real-world applications, ensuring efficient use of modern multi-core processors.

#### **Project Overview**

The project involves developing a simulation application that models the spread of a disease within a population. The simulation will run iteratively, updating the state of each individual based on interactions with their neighbors. The primary goal is to optimize the application to maximize cache efficiency, minimize memory latency, and ensure smooth concurrency.

##### **Scenario**

The simulation models a grid-based population where each cell represents an individual. Individuals can be in one of three states: Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered. At each step, infected individuals can potentially spread the disease to their susceptible neighbors. The simulation will run for a fixed number of iterations, updating the grid at each step.

- **Susceptible**: Healthy individuals who can become infected.
- **Infected**: Individuals currently infected with the disease.
- **Recovered**: Individuals who have recovered and are immune.

##### **Initial Requirements**

1. **Grid Representation**: The population is represented as a 2D grid.
2. **State Update**: At each iteration, update the state of each individual based on the states of their neighbors.
3. **Concurrency**: The simulation should leverage multi-core processors to run iterations concurrently.
4. **Cache Optimization**: Optimize data structures and access patterns to enhance cache performance.

##### **Example Use Case**

In a smart city application, such a simulation can be used to model the spread of infectious diseases and help in planning containment strategies. Efficient simulation ensures timely and accurate predictions, which are crucial for public health decisions.

#### **Objectives**

The main objectives of the project are to:

1. **Optimize Data Structures**: Design data structures that enhance cache locality and reduce cache misses.
2. **Improve Memory Access Patterns**: Ensure memory accesses are predictable and sequential to leverage spatial and temporal locality.
3. **Enhance Concurrency**: Implement concurrency mechanisms that minimize contention and maximize parallelism.
4. **Profile and Analyze Performance**: Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and validate optimizations.
5. **Achieve Real-Time Performance**: Ensure the simulation runs efficiently on modern multi-core processors, meeting real-time performance requirements.

#### **Project Steps**

To achieve these objectives, the project will follow a structured approach:

1. **Initial Implementation**: Develop a baseline version of the simulation.
2. **Profiling and Analysis**: Profile the baseline implementation to identify performance bottlenecks.
3. **Data Structure Optimization**: Redesign data structures to improve cache locality.
4. **Memory Access Optimization**: Modify memory access patterns to be more cache-friendly.
5. **Concurrency Optimization**: Implement efficient concurrency mechanisms to reduce contention.
6. **Final Profiling and Validation**: Profile the optimized implementation to ensure performance improvements and validate against objectives.

#### **Initial Implementation**

The first step is to develop a baseline version of the simulation. This version will serve as the foundation for subsequent optimizations.

##### **Baseline Code**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

enum State { Susceptible, Infected, Recovered };

struct Individual {
    State state;
};

class Population {
public:
    Population(int size) : size(size), grid(size, std::vector<Individual>(size, {Susceptible})) {}

    void initialize(int initialInfected) {
        for (int i = 0; i < initialInfected; ++i) {
            int x = rand() % size;
            int y = rand() % size;
            grid[x][y].state = Infected;
        }
    }

    void simulateStep() {
        std::vector<std::vector<Individual>> newGrid = grid;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j].state == Infected) {
                    for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                        for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                            if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                            int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                            if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                                if (grid[ni][nj].state == Susceptible) {
                                    newGrid[ni][nj].state = Infected;
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        grid = newGrid;
    }

    void print() const {
        for (const auto& row : grid) {
            for (const auto& ind : row) {
                char c = ind.state == Susceptible ? 'S' : (ind.state == Infected ? 'I' : 'R');
                std::cout << c << " ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }

private:
    int size;
    std::vector<std::vector<Individual>> grid;
};

int main() {
    int gridSize = 10;
    int initialInfected = 5;
    int iterations = 10;

    Population population(gridSize);
    population.initialize(initialInfected);

    for (int i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        population.simulateStep();
        population.print();
        std::cout << "----------" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

##### **Initial Profiling and Analysis**

The baseline implementation is then profiled to identify areas for optimization. Tools such as `perf`, Valgrind, and custom logging are used to gather performance data.

- **Perf Analysis**: Used to collect metrics such as CPU cycles, cache misses, and memory access patterns.

    ```sh
    perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses,cache-references ./simulation
    ```

- **Valgrind Analysis**: Used with Cachegrind to analyze cache utilization.

    ```sh
    valgrind --tool=cachegrind ./simulation
    cg_annotate cachegrind.out.<pid>
    ```

**Findings from Profiling**:
- **High Cache Miss Rate**: The baseline implementation suffers from a high cache miss rate due to poor data locality.
- **Inefficient Memory Access**: The grid access pattern leads to frequent cache line invalidations and misses.
- **Contention on Shared Resources**: Concurrent access to the grid by multiple threads causes contention, reducing overall performance.

#### **Optimization Strategies**

Based on the profiling results, several optimization strategies will be implemented:

1. **Data Structure Optimization**: Redesign the grid to improve data locality and reduce cache misses.
2. **Memory Access Optimization**: Modify the memory access pattern to be more sequential and predictable.
3. **Concurrency Optimization**: Implement finer-grained locking or lock-free data structures to reduce contention.

##### **Data Structure Optimization**

The grid structure will be optimized to improve cache locality by storing states in a contiguous array.

**Optimized Data Structure**:

```cpp
class Population {
public:
    Population(int size) : size(size), grid(size * size, Susceptible) {}

    void initialize(int initialInfected) {
        for (int i = 0; i < initialInfected; ++i) {
            int index = rand() % (size * size);
            grid[index] = Infected;
        }
    }

    void simulateStep() {
        std::vector<State> newGrid = grid;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
                int index = i * size + j;
                if (grid[index] == Infected) {
                    for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                        for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                            if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                            int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                            if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                                int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                                if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                    newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        grid = newGrid;
    }

    void print() const {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
                char c = grid[i * size + j] == Susceptible ? 'S' : (grid[i * size + j] == Infected ? 'I' : 'R');
                std::cout << c << " ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }

private:
    int size;
    std::vector<State> grid;
};
```

##### **Memory Access Optimization**

The memory access pattern will be optimized to ensure sequential access, improving spatial locality and reducing cache misses.

**Optimized Memory Access Pattern**:

```cpp
void simulateStep() {
    std::vector<State> newGrid = grid;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        for (

int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
            int index = i * size + j;
            if (grid[index] == Infected) {
                for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                        if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                            int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                            if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    grid = newGrid;
}
```

##### **Concurrency Optimization**

To reduce contention, finer-grained locking or lock-free data structures will be implemented.

**Optimized Concurrency Mechanism**:

```cpp
void simulateStep() {
    std::vector<State> newGrid(size * size, Susceptible);
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    std::mutex gridMutex;

    auto updateGrid = [&](int start, int end) {
        for (int index = start; index < end; ++index) {
            int i = index / size;
            int j = index % size;
            if (grid[index] == Infected) {
                for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                        if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                            int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(gridMutex);
                            if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    };

    int numThreads = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
    int chunkSize = (size * size) / numThreads;
    for (int t = 0; t < numThreads; ++t) {
        int start = t * chunkSize;
        int end = (t == numThreads - 1) ? (size * size) : start + chunkSize;
        threads.emplace_back(updateGrid, start, end);
    }

    for (auto& thread : threads) {
        thread.join();
    }

    grid = newGrid;
}
```

#### **Final Profiling and Validation**

After implementing the optimization strategies, the simulation application will be re-profiled to evaluate performance improvements and validate against objectives.

**Performance Metrics**:

1. **Cache Miss Rate**: Expected reduction in cache miss rate, resulting in faster memory access and improved CPU efficiency.
2. **Throughput**: Increased throughput, enabling the simulation to handle more iterations and larger grids efficiently.
3. **Latency**: Decreased latency, ensuring quicker updates to the grid state and meeting real-time performance requirements.

##### **Real-Life Impact**

##### **Baseline Implementation**

Implement the initial version of the simulation with basic functionality.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

enum State { Susceptible, Infected, Recovered };

struct Individual {
    State state;
};

class Population {
public:
    Population(int size) : size(size), grid(size, std::vector<Individual>(size, {Susceptible})) {}

    void initialize(int initialInfected) {
        for (int i = 0; i < initialInfected; ++i) {
            int x = rand() % size;
            int y = rand() % size;
            grid[x][y].state = Infected;
        }
    }

    void simulateStep() {
        std::vector<std::vector<Individual>> newGrid = grid;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j].state == Infected) {

                            if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                            int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                            if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                                if (grid[ni][nj].state == Susceptible) {

}
```

##### **Optimization Implementation**

Apply the optimization strategies incrementally, starting with data structure optimization, followed by memory access pattern improvements, and finally concurrency optimizations.

**Data Structure Optimization**:

Optimize the grid structure to improve cache locality.

```cpp
class Population {
public:
    Population(int size) : size(size), grid(size * size, Susceptible) {}

    void initialize(int initialInfected) {
        for (int i = 0; i < initialInfected; ++i) {
            int index = rand() % (size * size);
            grid[index] = Infected;
        }
    }

    void simulateStep() {
        std::vector<State> newGrid = grid;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
                int index = i * size + j;
                if (grid[index] == Infected) {
                    for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                        for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                            if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                            int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                            if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                                int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                                if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                    newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        grid = newGrid;
    }

    void print() const {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
                char c = grid[i * size + j] == Susceptible ? 'S' : (grid[i * size + j] == Infected ? 'I' : 'R');
                std::cout << c << " ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }

private:
    int size;
    std::vector<State> grid;
};
```

**Memory Access Optimization**:

Modify the memory access pattern to ensure sequential and predictable access.

```cpp
void simulateStep() {
    std::vector<State> newGrid = grid;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
            int index = i * size + j;
            if (grid[index] == Infected) {
                for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                        if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                            int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                            if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    grid = newGrid;
}
```

**Concurrency Optimization**:

Implement finer-grained locking or lock-free data structures to reduce contention.

```cpp
void simulateStep() {
    std::vector<State> newGrid(size * size, Susceptible);
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    std::mutex gridMutex;

    auto updateGrid = [&](int start, int end) {
        for (int index = start; index < end; ++index) {
            int i = index / size;
            int j = index % size;
            if (grid[index] == Infected) {
                for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                        if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                            int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(gridMutex);
                            if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {


                                newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    };

    int numThreads = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
    int chunkSize = (size * size) / numThreads;
    for (int t = 0; t < numThreads; ++t) {
        int start = t * chunkSize;
        int end = (t == numThreads - 1) ? (size * size) : start + chunkSize;
        threads.emplace_back(updateGrid, start, end);
    }

    for (auto& thread : threads) {
        thread.join();
    }

    grid = newGrid;
}
```

#### **Step 3: Testing**

Thorough testing is crucial to ensure that the optimizations are effective and that the application meets its performance and functionality requirements.

##### **Unit Testing**

Implement unit tests to verify the correctness of individual components.

**Example Unit Test**:

```cpp
#include <cassert>

void testStateUpdate() {
    Population population(3);
    population.initialize(1);
    population.simulateStep();
    // Verify that the state update rules are applied correctly.
    // Add assertions to check the expected state of the grid.
}

int main() {
    testStateUpdate();
    std::cout << "All tests passed!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

##### **Performance Testing**

Measure performance metrics, such as cache miss rate, throughput, and latency, to validate the optimizations.

**Performance Profiling**:

```sh
perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses,cache-references ./simulation
valgrind --tool=cachegrind ./simulation
cg_annotate cachegrind.out.<pid>
```

##### **Integration Testing**

Ensure that all components work together seamlessly and that the application meets its overall performance and functionality requirements.

**Integration Test**:

```cpp
int main() {
    int gridSize = 10;
    int initialInfected = 5;
    int iterations = 10;

    Population population(gridSize);
    population.initialize(initialInfected);

    for (int i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        population.simulateStep();
        population.print();
        std::cout << "----------" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

##### **Stress Testing**

Test the application under high load to ensure it can handle large grid sizes and high concurrency levels.

**Stress Test**:

```cpp
int main() {
    int gridSize = 1000;
    int initialInfected = 100;
    int iterations = 10;

    Population population(gridSize);
    population.initialize(initialInfected);

    for (int i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        population.simulateStep();
        // Optionally, print or log the state to verify correctness.
        std::cout << "Iteration " << i << " completed." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Conclusion**

Developing a cache-friendly application requires careful planning, coding, and thorough testing. By following this step-by-step guide, you can systematically address performance bottlenecks and optimize your application for efficient cache utilization. The strategies discussed, including data structure optimization, memory access pattern improvements, and concurrency optimization, provide a comprehensive approach to enhancing the performance of cache-friendly applications. These techniques are applicable to a wide range of real-world applications, ensuring efficient use of modern multi-core processors and meeting stringent performance requirements.



### 10.3 Review and Optimization Techniques

Developing a cache-friendly application involves not only initial design and implementation but also ongoing review and optimization to ensure the application performs efficiently under varying workloads. This section reviews key optimization techniques applied in the project and discusses additional strategies that can be employed to further enhance cache performance.

#### **Review of Key Optimization Techniques**

In our disease spread simulation project, several critical optimization techniques were applied to improve cache performance, reduce latency, and enhance concurrency. Let’s review these techniques and their impact on the application.

##### **1. Data Structure Optimization**

**Original Approach**:
- The population grid was represented as a 2D vector of `Individual` structs. This layout resulted in scattered memory access patterns, leading to high cache miss rates.

**Optimized Approach**:
- The grid was transformed into a 1D vector, storing states contiguously. This layout improved spatial locality, reducing cache misses significantly.

**Impact**:
- By optimizing the data structure, cache line utilization was maximized, leading to a noticeable reduction in memory latency and improved overall performance.

**Example**:
```cpp
class Population {
public:
    Population(int size) : size(size), grid(size * size, Susceptible) {}
    // Initialization and simulation functions...
private:
    int size;
    std::vector<State> grid;
};
```

##### **2. Memory Access Pattern Optimization**

**Original Approach**:
- The initial memory access pattern was non-sequential, causing frequent cache line invalidations and poor cache performance.

**Optimized Approach**:
- The memory access pattern was modified to be more sequential and predictable, leveraging spatial and temporal locality. This change reduced the number of cache misses and improved data access times.

**Impact**:
- Sequential memory access patterns enhanced cache efficiency, resulting in faster data retrieval and smoother simulation updates.

**Example**:
```cpp
void simulateStep() {
    std::vector<State> newGrid = grid;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
            int index = i * size + j;
            if (grid[index] == Infected) {
                for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                        if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                            int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                            if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    grid = newGrid;
}
```

##### **3. Concurrency Optimization**

**Original Approach**:
- The initial implementation used coarse-grained locking, leading to high contention and reduced parallel efficiency.

**Optimized Approach**:
- Finer-grained locking and lock-free data structures were implemented to reduce contention. Thread and memory affinity were also leveraged to improve data locality and parallel execution.

**Impact**:
- These changes significantly reduced synchronization overhead and improved the scalability and throughput of the simulation under high concurrency.

**Example**:
```cpp
void simulateStep() {
    std::vector<State> newGrid(size * size, Susceptible);
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    std::mutex gridMutex;

    auto updateGrid = [&](int start, int end) {
        for (int index = start; index < end; ++index) {
            int i = index / size;
            int j = index % size;
            if (grid[index] == Infected) {
                for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                        if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                            int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(gridMutex);
                            if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    };

    int numThreads = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
    int chunkSize = (size * size) / numThreads;
    for (int t = 0; t < numThreads; ++t) {
        int start = t * chunkSize;
        int end = (t == numThreads - 1) ? (size * size) : start + chunkSize;
        threads.emplace_back(updateGrid, start, end);
    }

    for (auto& thread : threads) {
        thread.join();
    }

    grid = newGrid;
}
```

#### **Additional Optimization Techniques**

Beyond the techniques already applied, several additional strategies can be employed to further optimize cache performance and overall application efficiency.

##### **4. Prefetching**

Prefetching involves loading data into the cache before it is actually needed, reducing cache misses and improving access times. Hardware prefetching can be leveraged, or software prefetching techniques can be implemented manually.

**Example**:
```cpp
void simulateStep() {
    std::vector<State> newGrid = grid;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
            int index = i * size + j;
            // Prefetch the next cache line
            __builtin_prefetch(&grid[index + 1], 0, 1);
            if (grid[index] == Infected) {
                for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                        if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                            int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                            if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    grid = newGrid;
}
```

##### **5. Loop Unrolling**

Loop unrolling increases the number of operations performed within a single loop iteration, reducing the overhead of loop control and increasing instruction-level parallelism.

**Example**:
```cpp
void simulateStep() {
    std::vector<State> newGrid = grid;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < size; j += 2) {
            int index1 = i * size + j;
            int index2 = index1 + 1;
            // Process two elements per iteration
            if (grid[index1] == Infected) {
                for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                        if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                            int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                            if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            if (grid[index2] == Infected) {
                for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                        if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                            int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                            if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                newGrid[neighborIndex] = Infected;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    grid = newGrid;
}
```

##### **6. NUMA-Aware Optimizations**

For systems with Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA), ensuring that memory allocation and thread execution are localized to the same NUMA node can significantly reduce memory access latency.

**Example**:
```cpp
#include <numa.h>

void* allocateLocalMemory(size_t size, int node) {
    void* ptr = numa_alloc_onnode(size, node);
    if (ptr == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "NUMA allocation failed!" << std::endl;
        exit(1);
    }
    return ptr;
}

void setThreadAffinity(int cpu) {
    cpu_set_t cpuset;
    CPU_ZERO(&cpuset);
    CPU_SET(cpu, &cpuset);

    if (pthread_setaffinity_np(pthread_self(), sizeof(cpu_set_t), &cpuset) != 0) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to set thread affinity!" << std::endl;
    }
}

// Use NUMA-aware allocation for the grid
Population::Population(int size) : size(size

) {
    int node = numa_node_of_cpu(sched_getcpu());
    grid = static_cast<State*>(allocateLocalMemory(size * size * sizeof(State), node));
    std::fill(grid, grid + size * size, Susceptible);
}
```

##### **7. Lock-Free Data Structures**

Lock-free data structures can reduce contention and improve parallel performance, especially in highly concurrent environments.

**Example**:
```cpp
#include <atomic>

void simulateStep() {
    std::vector<std::atomic<State>> newGrid(size * size);
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    auto updateGrid = [&](int start, int end) {
        for (int index = start; index < end; ++index) {
            int i = index / size;
            int j = index % size;
            if (grid[index] == Infected) {
                for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                        if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue;
                        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < size && nj >= 0 && nj < size) {
                            int neighborIndex = ni * size + nj;
                            if (grid[neighborIndex] == Susceptible) {
                                newGrid[neighborIndex].store(Infected, std::memory_order_relaxed);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    };

    int numThreads = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
    int chunkSize = (size * size) / numThreads;
    for (int t = 0; t < numThreads; ++t) {
        int start = t * chunkSize;
        int end = (t == numThreads - 1) ? (size * size) : start + chunkSize;
        threads.emplace_back(updateGrid, start, end);
    }

    for (auto& thread : threads) {
        thread.join();
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < size * size; ++i) {
        grid[i] = newGrid[i].load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
    }
}
```

#### **Conclusion**

Developing a cache-friendly application is an iterative process that involves continuous review and optimization. By applying data structure optimization, memory access pattern improvements, concurrency optimization, and additional techniques such as prefetching, loop unrolling, NUMA-aware optimizations, and lock-free data structures, significant performance improvements can be achieved.

Real-life examples, such as the disease spread simulation project, demonstrate how these techniques can be implemented to enhance cache efficiency and overall performance. By thoroughly understanding and applying these optimization strategies, developers can create high-performance applications that effectively leverage modern multi-core processors and meet stringent performance requirements.
