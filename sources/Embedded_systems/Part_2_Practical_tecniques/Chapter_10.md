## **10. Advanced C++ Features in Embedded Systems**

As embedded systems evolve, the need for efficient, reusable, and maintainable code becomes increasingly critical. Advanced C++ features offer powerful tools to address these needs. In this chapter, we delve into the sophisticated capabilities of C++ that can significantly enhance embedded system development. We begin with templates and metaprogramming, exploring how these techniques promote code reuse and efficiency. Next, we examine lambdas and functional programming, showcasing how modern C++ features can be effectively leveraged in an embedded context. Finally, we discuss signal handling and event management, demonstrating the implementation of robust signals and event handlers to improve system responsiveness and reliability. Through these advanced features, developers can push the boundaries of embedded system performance and capability.

### 10.1. Templates and Metaprogramming

Templates and metaprogramming are two of the most powerful features of C++, offering a way to write generic, reusable, and efficient code. In embedded systems, where resources are often limited and performance is critical, these features can be invaluable. This subchapter will explore the use of templates and metaprogramming in embedded systems, providing detailed explanations and practical code examples.

#### 10.1.1. Introduction to Templates

Templates allow you to write generic code that works with any data type. They are a cornerstone of C++'s type system and are widely used in the Standard Template Library (STL). There are two main types of templates in C++: function templates and class templates.

**Function Templates**

Function templates enable you to write a function that works with any data type. Here’s a simple example:

```cpp
template<typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 10;
    double a = 5.5, b = 10.5;

    int intResult = add(x, y);       // Works with integers
    double doubleResult = add(a, b); // Works with doubles

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `add` function template works with both integers and doubles, demonstrating the flexibility templates provide.

**Class Templates**

Class templates allow you to create classes that work with any data type. Here’s an example:

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Pair {
public:
    Pair(T first, T second) : first_(first), second_(second) {}

    T getFirst() const { return first_; }
    T getSecond() const { return second_; }

private:
    T first_;
    T second_;
};

int main() {
    Pair<int> intPair(1, 2);
    Pair<double> doublePair(3.5, 4.5);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Pair` class can store pairs of integers or doubles, illustrating the power of class templates to create generic data structures.

#### 10.1.2. Advanced Template Features

Templates are not limited to simple data types. They can be combined with other features to create powerful abstractions.

**Template Specialization**

Sometimes, you need to handle specific types differently. Template specialization allows you to provide a custom implementation for a particular data type.

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Printer {
public:
    void print(const T& value) {
        std::cout << value << std::endl;
    }
};

// Specialization for char*
template<>
class Printer<char*> {
public:
    void print(const char* value) {
        std::cout << "String: " << value << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Printer<int> intPrinter;
    intPrinter.print(42);

    Printer<char*> stringPrinter;
    stringPrinter.print("Hello, World!");

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Printer` class template is specialized for `char*` to handle strings differently.

**Variadic Templates**

Variadic templates allow you to create functions and classes that take an arbitrary number of template arguments. They are useful for creating flexible interfaces.

```cpp
template<typename... Args>
void printAll(Args... args) {
    (std::cout << ... << args) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    printAll(1, 2, 3.5, "Hello");

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `printAll` function template can take any number of arguments of any type and print them.

#### 10.1.3. Template Metaprogramming

Template metaprogramming (TMP) uses templates to perform computations at compile time. This technique can optimize performance by shifting work from runtime to compile time.

**Compile-Time Factorial Calculation**

A classic example of TMP is calculating factorials at compile time.

```cpp
template<int N>
struct Factorial {
    static const int value = N * Factorial<N - 1>::value;
};

template<>
struct Factorial<0> {
    static const int value = 1;
};

int main() {
    int factorial5 = Factorial<5>::value; // Calculated at compile time

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the factorial of 5 is computed at compile time, resulting in efficient code.

**Type Traits**

Type traits are a form of TMP used to query and manipulate types at compile time. The C++ standard library provides a rich set of type traits.

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

template<typename T>
void checkType() {
    if (std::is_integral<T>::value) {
        std::cout << "Integral type" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Non-integral type" << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    checkType<int>();    // Integral type
    checkType<double>(); // Non-integral type

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::is_integral` is used to check if a type is an integral type at compile time.

#### 10.1.4. Templates in Embedded Systems

In embedded systems, templates can be used to create highly efficient and reusable code.

**Template-Based Fixed-Point Arithmetic**

Fixed-point arithmetic is often used in embedded systems to handle fractional numbers without floating-point hardware.

```cpp
template<int FractionBits>
class FixedPoint {
public:
    FixedPoint(int value) : value_(value << FractionBits) {}

    int getValue() const { return value_ >> FractionBits; }

private:
    int value_;
};

int main() {
    FixedPoint<8> fixed(3.5 * (1 << 8)); // 3.5 in fixed-point with 8 fractional bits

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `FixedPoint` class template provides a way to perform fixed-point arithmetic with a specified number of fractional bits.

**Template-Based Peripheral Interfaces**

Templates can also be used to create flexible and efficient peripheral interfaces.

```cpp
template<typename Port, int Pin>
class DigitalOut {
public:
    void setHigh() {
        Port::setPinHigh(Pin);
    }

    void setLow() {
        Port::setPinLow(Pin);
    }
};

class GPIOA {
public:
    static void setPinHigh(int pin) {
        // Set pin high (implementation specific)
    }

    static void setPinLow(int pin) {
        // Set pin low (implementation specific)
    }
};

int main() {
    DigitalOut<GPIOA, 5> led;
    led.setHigh();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `DigitalOut` class template provides a generic interface for controlling digital output pins, which can be specialized for different ports.

#### 10.1.5. Conclusion

Templates and metaprogramming offer powerful tools for creating efficient, reusable, and maintainable code in embedded systems. By leveraging these features, developers can write generic code that performs well on resource-constrained devices. From simple function and class templates to advanced metaprogramming techniques, C++ templates provide the flexibility and performance needed for modern embedded system development. Through practical examples and detailed explanations, this subchapter has demonstrated how to effectively use templates and metaprogramming in your embedded projects.

### 10.2. Lambdas and Functional Programming

Modern C++ introduces several features that make functional programming more accessible, even in the context of embedded systems. Among these features, lambdas stand out as a powerful tool for creating concise and expressive code. In this subchapter, we will explore lambdas and their role in bringing functional programming paradigms to C++ for embedded systems, complete with detailed explanations and practical code examples.

#### 10.2.1. Introduction to Lambdas

Lambdas, or lambda expressions, are anonymous functions that can be defined within the context of other functions. They are particularly useful for creating short snippets of code that are used once or passed to algorithms.

**Basic Syntax**

A lambda expression has the following basic syntax:

```cpp
[ capture-list ] ( params ) -> ret { body }
```

- **Capture List**: Defines which variables from the enclosing scope are accessible in the lambda.
- **Params**: Specifies the parameters the lambda takes.
- **Ret**: (Optional) Specifies the return type.
- **Body**: The code executed by the lambda.

Here is a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    auto add = [](int a, int b) -> int {
        return a + b;
    };

    std::cout << "Sum: " << add(5, 3) << std::endl; // Outputs: Sum: 8

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `add` is a lambda that takes two integers and returns their sum.

#### 10.2.2. Capturing Variables

Lambdas can capture variables from their surrounding scope, allowing them to access and modify those variables.

**Capturing by Value**

When capturing by value, a copy of the variable is made:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 10;

    auto printX = [x]() {
        std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;
    };

    x = 20;
    printX(); // Outputs: x = 10

    return 0;
}
```

**Capturing by Reference**

When capturing by reference, the lambda accesses the original variable:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 10;

    auto printX = [&x]() {
        std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;
    };

    x = 20;
    printX(); // Outputs: x = 20

    return 0;
}
```

**Capturing Everything**

You can capture all local variables either by value or by reference:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;

    auto captureAllByValue = [=]() {
        std::cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;
    };

    auto captureAllByReference = [&]() {
        std::cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;
    };

    x = 30;
    y = 40;

    captureAllByValue(); // Outputs: x = 10, y = 20
    captureAllByReference(); // Outputs: x = 30, y = 40

    return 0;
}
```

#### 10.2.3. Lambdas in Algorithms

Lambdas are particularly useful when working with the STL algorithms, providing a way to define the behavior of the algorithm inline.

**Using Lambdas with `std::sort`**

```cpp
#include <algorithm>

#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7};

    std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [](int a, int b) {
        return a < b;
    });

    for (int n : numbers) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
    // Outputs: 1 2 4 5 7 8

    return 0;
}
```

**Using Lambdas with `std::for_each`**

```cpp
#include <algorithm>

#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    std::for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [](int& n) {
        n *= 2;
    });

    for (int n : numbers) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
    // Outputs: 2 4 6 8 10

    return 0;
}
```

#### 10.2.4. Functional Programming Concepts

C++ supports several functional programming concepts, which can be leveraged to write cleaner and more efficient code.

**Immutability**

Functional programming emphasizes immutability, where data structures are not modified after they are created. While C++ does not enforce immutability, you can design your code to minimize mutable state.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    const int x = 5;
    const int y = 10;

    std::cout << "Sum: " << add(x, y) << std::endl; // Outputs: Sum: 15

    return 0;
}
```

**Higher-Order Functions**

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. Lambdas make it easy to create and use higher-order functions in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <functional>

std::function<int(int)> makeAdder(int addend) {
    return [addend](int value) {
        return value + addend;
    };
}

int main() {
    auto addFive = makeAdder(5);
    std::cout << "Result: " << addFive(10) << std::endl; // Outputs: Result: 15

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `makeAdder` returns a lambda that adds a specified value to its argument, demonstrating the use of higher-order functions.

**Currying**

Currying is the process of breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <functional>

std::function<std::function<int(int)>(int)> curryAdd() {
    return [](int x) {
        return [x](int y) {
            return x + y;
        };
    };
}

int main() {
    auto add = curryAdd();
    auto addFive = add(5);
    std::cout << "Result: " << addFive(10) << std::endl; // Outputs: Result: 15

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `curryAdd` creates a curried addition function.

#### 10.2.5. Lambdas and Embedded Systems

Lambdas and functional programming can greatly enhance the readability and maintainability of embedded systems code. Here are a few practical examples of using lambdas in embedded systems.

**Timer Callbacks**

Lambdas can be used to create concise and expressive timer callbacks.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <functional>
#include <thread>

#include <chrono>

void setTimer(int delay, std::function<void()> callback) {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(delay));
    callback();
}

int main() {
    setTimer(1000, []() {
        std::cout << "Timer expired!" << std::endl;
    });

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a lambda is used as a callback function for a timer.

**Event Handling**

Lambdas can simplify event handling code, making it more readable.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <functional>
#include <vector>

class EventEmitter {
public:
    void onEvent(std::function<void(int)> listener) {
        listeners.push_back(listener);
    }

    void emitEvent(int eventData) {
        for (auto& listener : listeners) {
            listener(eventData);
        }
    }

private:
    std::vector<std::function<void(int)>> listeners;
};

int main() {
    EventEmitter emitter;

    emitter.onEvent([](int data) {
        std::cout << "Received event with data: " << data << std::endl;
    });

    emitter.emitEvent(42); // Outputs: Received event with data: 42

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a lambda is used as an event listener, demonstrating how lambdas can be used to handle events in an embedded system.

#### 10.2.6. Conclusion

Lambdas and functional programming features in C++ provide powerful tools for embedded systems developers. By allowing for concise, expressive, and reusable code, these features can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of embedded systems code. From simple lambdas and capture lists to higher-order functions and currying, modern C++ brings functional programming paradigms into the realm of embedded systems, offering new ways to write efficient and elegant code. Through practical examples and detailed explanations, this subchapter has demonstrated how to effectively use lambdas and functional programming in your embedded projects.

### 10.3. Signal Handling and Event Management

In embedded systems, responding to events and managing signals efficiently is crucial for ensuring responsive and reliable performance. This subchapter delves into the concepts of signal handling and event management in C++ within the context of embedded systems. We will explore various techniques and provide practical code examples to illustrate their implementation.

#### 10.3.1. Introduction to Signal Handling and Event Management

Signal handling and event management are fundamental aspects of embedded systems programming. Signals represent asynchronous events that the system must respond to, such as hardware interrupts or software-triggered events. Event management involves the organization, prioritization, and handling of these signals to ensure the system's smooth operation.

**Signal Handling** involves dealing with asynchronous events, often originating from hardware interrupts, software exceptions, or user inputs. Effective signal handling ensures that the system can react promptly to critical events.

**Event Management** is the broader context in which signal handling occurs. It includes the infrastructure for event registration, prioritization, and dispatching. In C++, this can be implemented using various programming constructs, including function pointers, functors, and modern features like lambdas and the `<functional>` library.

#### 10.3.2. Basic Signal Handling

In C++, signal handling can be implemented using function pointers or callback functions. Let’s start with a simple example using function pointers to handle events.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void onSignalReceived(int signal) {
    std::cout << "Signal received: " << signal << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    void (*signalHandler)(int) = onSignalReceived;

    // Simulate signal reception
    signalHandler(1); // Outputs: Signal received: 1

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `signalHandler` is a function pointer that points to the `onSignalReceived` function. When a signal is received, the corresponding function is called.

#### 10.3.3. Advanced Signal Handling with Functors

Functors, or function objects, offer a more flexible way to handle signals. They are objects that can be called as if they were functions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class SignalHandler {
public:
    void operator()(int signal) const {
        std::cout << "Signal received: " << signal << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    SignalHandler handler;

    // Simulate signal reception
    handler(1); // Outputs: Signal received: 1

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `SignalHandler` is a functor that handles signals. Using functors allows you to maintain state and behavior within a class.

#### 10.3.4. Using Lambdas for Signal Handling

Modern C++ introduces lambdas, which provide a concise way to define inline signal handlers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <functional>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<std::function<void(int)>> signalHandlers;

    // Register a lambda as a signal handler
    signalHandlers.push_back([](int signal) {
        std::cout << "Signal received: " << signal << std::endl;
    });

    // Simulate signal reception
    for (auto& handler : signalHandlers) {
        handler(1); // Outputs: Signal received: 1
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a lambda is used as a signal handler and registered in a vector of `std::function<void(int)>`. This approach allows for multiple signal handlers to be easily managed and invoked.

#### 10.3.5. Event Management with Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a common design pattern for event management. It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where one object (the subject) notifies multiple observers of state changes.

**Implementing the Observer Pattern**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <vector>
#include <functional>

class Subject {
public:
    void addObserver(const std::function<void(int)>& observer) {
        observers.push_back(observer);
    }

    void notify(int event) {
        for (auto& observer : observers) {
            observer(event);
        }
    }

private:
    std::vector<std::function<void(int)>> observers;
};

class Observer {
public:
    Observer(const std::string& name) : name(name) {}

    void onEvent(int event) {
        std::cout << "Observer " << name << " received event: " << event << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string name;
};

int main() {
    Subject subject;

    Observer observer1("A");
    Observer observer2("B");

    subject.addObserver([&observer1](int event) { observer1.onEvent(event); });
    subject.addObserver([&observer2](int event) { observer2.onEvent(event); });

    // Simulate event
    subject.notify(42);
    // Outputs:
    // Observer A received event: 42
    // Observer B received event: 42

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Subject` class manages a list of observers and notifies them of events. The `Observer` class represents an entity that reacts to events. This pattern decouples event generation from event handling, enhancing modularity.

#### 10.3.6. Event Queues and Dispatchers

In embedded systems, it’s common to use event queues and dispatchers to manage events. This allows for asynchronous event processing and prioritization.

**Implementing an Event Queue**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <queue>
#include <functional>

struct Event {
    int type;
    int data;
};

class EventDispatcher {
public:
    void addHandler(int eventType, const std::function<void(int)>& handler) {
        handlers[eventType].push_back(handler);
    }

    void pushEvent(const Event& event) {
        eventQueue.push(event);
    }

    void processEvents() {
        while (!eventQueue.empty()) {
            Event event = eventQueue.front();
            eventQueue.pop();

            if (handlers.find(event.type) != handlers.end()) {
                for (auto& handler : handlers[event.type]) {
                    handler(event.data);
                }
            }
        }
    }

private:
    std::queue<Event> eventQueue;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<std::function<void(int)>>> handlers;
};

int main() {
    EventDispatcher dispatcher;

    dispatcher.addHandler(1, [](int data) {
        std::cout << "Handler 1 received data: " << data << std::endl;
    });

    dispatcher.addHandler(2, [](int data) {
        std::cout << "Handler 2 received data: " << data << std::endl;
    });

    dispatcher.pushEvent({1, 100});
    dispatcher.pushEvent({2, 200});

    dispatcher.processEvents();
    // Outputs:
    // Handler 1 received data: 100
    // Handler 2 received data: 200

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `EventDispatcher` manages event handlers and an event queue. Events are pushed to the queue and processed in a FIFO order, invoking the appropriate handlers based on the event type.

#### 10.3.7. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) Integration

In more complex embedded systems, an RTOS can manage tasks and events, providing more advanced scheduling and prioritization.

**Using FreeRTOS for Event Handling**

```cpp
#include <FreeRTOS.h>

#include <task.h>
#include <queue.h>

#include <iostream>

struct Event {
    int type;
    int data;
};

QueueHandle_t eventQueue;

void eventProducerTask(void* pvParameters) {
    int eventType = 1;
    int eventData = 100;

    Event event = {eventType, eventData};
    xQueueSend(eventQueue, &event, portMAX_DELAY);

    vTaskDelete(NULL);
}

void eventConsumerTask(void* pvParameters) {
    Event event;

    while (true) {
        if (xQueueReceive(eventQueue, &event, portMAX_DELAY) == pdPASS) {
            std::cout << "Received event: " << event.type << ", data: " << event.data << std::endl;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    eventQueue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(Event));

    xTaskCreate(eventProducerTask, "Producer", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, 1, NULL);
    xTaskCreate(eventConsumerTask, "Consumer", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, 1, NULL);

    vTaskStartScheduler();

    return 0;
