## 8. Debugging and Testing Embedded C++ Applications

Chapter 8 delves into the crucial aspects of ensuring the reliability and efficiency of embedded C++ applications through robust debugging and testing methodologies. In this chapter, we will explore essential debugging techniques, equipping you with tools and strategies to effectively identify and resolve issues in your code. We will also discuss unit testing in the context of embedded systems, highlighting frameworks and best practices to ensure each component of your application functions as intended. Additionally, we'll cover static code analysis, a proactive approach to catching errors before they manifest at runtime. Finally, we'll examine profiling and performance tuning, guiding you in pinpointing performance bottlenecks and optimizing your application for maximum efficiency. Through these comprehensive topics, this chapter aims to provide you with the skills necessary to develop high-quality, reliable embedded systems.

### 8.1. Debugging Techniques

Debugging embedded C++ applications can be particularly challenging due to the constrained environments and the specialized hardware involved. This subchapter will cover various debugging techniques, tools, and best practices to help you effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues in your embedded systems.

#### 8.1.1. Basic Debugging Techniques

##### Print Statements

One of the simplest and most widely used debugging techniques is adding print statements to your code. This approach allows you to track the flow of execution and inspect variable values at different points.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void myFunction(int x) {
    std::cout << "Entering myFunction with x = " << x << std::endl;
    // ... function logic ...
    std::cout << "Exiting myFunction" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    std::cout << "Initial value of a: " << a << std::endl;
    myFunction(a);
    return 0;
}
```

While print statements are easy to use, they can be intrusive and may not be suitable for real-time systems where timing is critical.

##### LED Indicators

In embedded systems, where standard output might not be available, you can use hardware indicators like LEDs to signal different states or values.

```cpp
#include "mbed.h"

DigitalOut led1(LED1);
DigitalOut led2(LED2);

void indicateState(int state) {
    if (state == 1) {
        led1 = 1; // Turn on LED1
        led2 = 0; // Turn off LED2
    } else if (state == 2) {
        led1 = 0;
        led2 = 1;
    } else {
        led1 = 0;
        led2 = 0;
    }
}

int main() {
    int state = 1;
    while (true) {
        indicateState(state);
        state = (state % 2) + 1;
        wait(1.0);
    }
}
```

Using LEDs can be particularly useful in debugging early boot stages or critical sections where serial output is not feasible.

#### 8.1.2. Using a Debugger

##### GDB

The GNU Debugger (GDB) is a powerful tool for debugging C++ applications. It allows you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and control the execution flow of your program.

To use GDB with an embedded system, you typically need a GDB server, such as OpenOCD, that interfaces with your hardware.

```sh
# Start the GDB server
openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg

# In another terminal, start GDB and connect to the server
arm-none-eabi-gdb my_program.elf
(gdb) target remote localhost:3333
(gdb) load
(gdb) monitor reset init
(gdb) break main
(gdb) continue
```

In GDB, you can set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect memory and registers:

```sh
(gdb) break myFunction
(gdb) run
(gdb) print x
(gdb) next
(gdb) continue
```

##### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Many IDEs, such as Eclipse, Visual Studio, and CLion, provide integrated debugging support with graphical interfaces, making it easier to set breakpoints, watch variables, and visualize the call stack.

###### Eclipse Setup

1. **Install Eclipse for Embedded C/C++ Developers**.
2. **Install the GNU ARM Eclipse plugins**.
3. **Create a new project** and configure it for your target hardware.
4. **Set up your debugger** (e.g., GDB server settings).
5. **Build and debug your project**.

```cpp
#include "mbed.h"

DigitalOut led(LED1);

int main() {
    while (true) {
        led = !led;
        wait(0.5);
    }
}
```

Using the Eclipse debugger, you can set breakpoints by double-clicking in the left margin next to the line number, inspect variables by hovering over them, and control execution with the toolbar buttons.

#### 8.1.3. Advanced Debugging Techniques

##### Real-Time Trace and Profiling

For real-time systems, tracing and profiling tools can provide insights into the timing and performance of your code. Tools like Segger J-Link and ARM's Trace Debug Interface (TPIU) allow you to capture and analyze execution traces.

###### Segger J-Link Example

1. **Set up the J-Link hardware and software**.
2. **Configure your project to enable tracing**.

```cpp
#include "mbed.h"

DigitalOut led(LED1);

int main() {
    SEGGER_SYSVIEW_Conf(); // Configure SEGGER SystemView
    while (true) {
        SEGGER_SYSVIEW_Print("Toggling LED");
        led = !led;
        wait(0.5);
    }
}
```

3. **Use the SEGGER SystemView software** to capture and analyze the trace data.

##### Memory Inspection and Manipulation

In embedded systems, inspecting and manipulating memory directly can be crucial for debugging hardware-related issues.

```cpp
#include "mbed.h"

int main() {
    uint32_t *ptr = (uint32_t *)0x20000000; // Example memory address
    *ptr = 0xDEADBEEF; // Write a value to memory
    uint32_t value = *ptr; // Read the value back
    printf("Memory value: 0x%08X\n", value);
    return 0;
}
```

Using a debugger, you can inspect and modify memory regions directly:

```sh
(gdb) x/4x 0x20000000
(gdb) set {int}0x20000000 = 0xCAFEBABE
(gdb) x/4x 0x20000000
```

#### 8.1.4. Best Practices for Effective Debugging

- **Isolate and Reproduce**: Narrow down the problem to a minimal test case that reliably reproduces the issue.
- **Use Version Control**: Keep your code under version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and revert to known good states.
- **Document Findings**: Keep a detailed log of your debugging process, including hypotheses, tests, and results.
- **Stay Methodical**: Approach debugging systematically, changing one variable at a time and thoroughly testing each hypothesis.

By mastering these debugging techniques, you can efficiently identify and resolve issues in your embedded C++ applications, ensuring they run reliably and perform optimally in their target environments.

### 8.2. Unit Testing in Embedded Systems

Unit testing is a critical component of software development, providing a way to verify that individual components of your application work as intended. In embedded systems, unit testing poses unique challenges due to hardware dependencies and limited resources. This subchapter will explore frameworks and strategies for effective unit testing in embedded C++ applications.

#### 8.2.1. Importance of Unit Testing

Unit testing offers several benefits, including:

- **Early Bug Detection**: Catching bugs early in the development cycle.
- **Documentation**: Serving as a form of documentation for how code is supposed to work.
- **Refactoring Safety**: Making it safer to refactor code by ensuring existing functionality remains intact.
- **Regression Prevention**: Preventing regressions by ensuring that changes do not introduce new bugs.

#### 8.2.2. Choosing a Unit Testing Framework

There are several unit testing frameworks available for C++ that can be used in embedded systems. Some popular choices include:

- **CppUTest**: A lightweight testing framework designed for embedded systems.
- **Google Test**: A more feature-rich framework that can be used in embedded contexts.
- **Unity**: A small, simple framework suitable for resource-constrained environments.

For the purposes of this subchapter, we will focus on CppUTest due to its simplicity and suitability for embedded systems.

#### 8.2.3. Setting Up CppUTest

##### Installation

To install CppUTest, you can download it from its [official repository](https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest.git
cd cpputest
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

##### Writing Your First Test

Let's write a simple example to demonstrate how to use CppUTest.

1. **Create a Simple Class**: We'll create a simple `Calculator` class with basic arithmetic functions.

```cpp
// Calculator.h
#ifndef CALCULATOR_H
#define CALCULATOR_H

class Calculator {
public:
    int add(int a, int b);
    int subtract(int a, int b);
};

#endif // CALCULATOR_H
```

```cpp
// Calculator.cpp
#include "Calculator.h"

int Calculator::add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int Calculator::subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}
```

2. **Write Unit Tests**: Next, we'll write unit tests for the `Calculator` class.

```cpp
// CalculatorTest.cpp
#include "CppUTest/TestHarness.h"
#include "Calculator.h"

TEST_GROUP(CalculatorTest) {
    Calculator* calculator;

    void setup() {
        calculator = new Calculator();
    }

    void teardown() {
        delete calculator;
    }
};

TEST(CalculatorTest, Addition) {
    CHECK_EQUAL(5, calculator->add(2, 3));
    CHECK_EQUAL(-1, calculator->add(2, -3));
}

TEST(CalculatorTest, Subtraction) {
    CHECK_EQUAL(1, calculator->subtract(3, 2));
    CHECK_EQUAL(5, calculator->subtract(2, -3));
}
```

3. **Run the Tests**: Compile and run the tests.

```sh
g++ -I. -I/usr/local/include/CppUTest -L/usr/local/lib -lCppUTest Calculator.cpp CalculatorTest.cpp -o CalculatorTest
./CalculatorTest
```

You should see output indicating whether the tests passed or failed.

#### 8.2.4. Testing Embedded Code

Unit testing embedded code can be more complex due to hardware dependencies. Here are some strategies to manage this:

##### Mocking Hardware Dependencies

Mocking allows you to simulate hardware components, making it possible to run tests on your development machine.

```cpp
// MockGPIO.h
#ifndef MOCKGPIO_H
#define MOCKGPIO_H

class MockGPIO {
public:
    void setHigh();
    void setLow();
    bool isHigh();
private:
    bool state;
};

#endif // MOCKGPIO_H
```

```cpp
// MockGPIO.cpp
#include "MockGPIO.h"

void MockGPIO::setHigh() {
    state = true;
}

void MockGPIO::setLow() {
    state = false;
}

bool MockGPIO::isHigh() {
    return state;
}
```

You can then use the mock class in your tests:

```cpp
// GPIOTest.cpp
#include "CppUTest/TestHarness.h"
#include "MockGPIO.h"

TEST_GROUP(GPIOTest) {
    MockGPIO* gpio;

    void setup() {
        gpio = new MockGPIO();
    }

    void teardown() {
        delete gpio;
    }
};

TEST(GPIOTest, SetHigh) {
    gpio->setHigh();
    CHECK_EQUAL(true, gpio->isHigh());
}

TEST(GPIOTest, SetLow) {
    gpio->setLow();
    CHECK_EQUAL(false, gpio->isHigh());
}
```

##### Testing with Hardware in the Loop

In some cases, you may need to run tests on actual hardware. This approach, known as Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing, allows you to validate your software in the target environment.

```cpp
// GPIO.h
#ifndef GPIO_H
#define GPIO_H

class GPIO {
public:
    void setHigh();
    void setLow();
    bool isHigh();
};

#endif // GPIO_H
```

```cpp
// GPIO.cpp
#include "GPIO.h"
#include "mbed.h"

DigitalOut led(LED1);

void GPIO::setHigh() {
    led = 1;
}

void GPIO::setLow() {
    led = 0;
}

bool GPIO::isHigh() {
    return led.read();
}
```

You can then deploy and run your tests on the embedded device.

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include "GPIO.h"

int main() {
    GPIO gpio;
    gpio.setHigh();
    // ... further testing logic ...
    return 0;
}
```

#### 8.2.5. Continuous Integration and Automated Testing

Automating your tests and integrating them into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline can greatly enhance your development workflow. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Travis CI can be configured to run your tests automatically whenever changes are pushed to your repository.

##### Setting Up Jenkins

1. **Install Jenkins**: Follow the instructions on the [Jenkins website](https://www.jenkins.io/) to install Jenkins on your server.

2. **Create a New Job**: In Jenkins, create a new freestyle project and configure it to pull your code from your version control system.

3. **Add Build Steps**: Add steps to build and run your unit tests.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
make clean
make all
./CalculatorTest
```

4. **Configure Triggers**: Set up triggers to run the job whenever changes are detected.

By integrating unit tests into a CI pipeline, you can ensure that your code is continuously tested and validated, reducing the likelihood of bugs slipping through to production.

#### 8.2.6. Best Practices for Unit Testing

- **Write Tests Early**: Write tests as you develop your code, not after.
- **Keep Tests Small and Focused**: Each test should focus on a single aspect of the code.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Test names should clearly describe what they are testing.
- **Run Tests Frequently**: Run your tests frequently to catch issues early.
- **Review Test Coverage**: Ensure that your tests cover all critical paths and edge cases.

By following these best practices and utilizing the techniques discussed in this subchapter, you can effectively incorporate unit testing into your embedded C++ development process, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.

### 8.3. Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining the source code before a program is run. This technique can identify potential errors, vulnerabilities, and code quality issues without executing the program. In embedded systems, where reliability and performance are critical, static code analysis is particularly valuable. This subchapter will explore tools and practices for performing static code analysis on embedded C++ applications.

#### 8.3.1. Benefits of Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis offers several benefits, including:

```

This command enables checks related to modern C++ practices and readability.

##### Example Code Analysis

Consider the following C++ code:

```cpp
// example.cpp
#include <iostream>

void process(int* data, size_t size) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if (data[i] == 0) {
            std::cout << "Zero found at index " << i << std::endl;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 0, 4, 5};
    process(arr, 5);
    return 0;
}
```

Running Clang-Tidy on this code might produce the following output:

```plaintext
example.cpp:4:17: warning: do not use pointer arithmetic [cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic]
    for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                ^
example.cpp:8:25: warning: prefer 'nullptr' to '0' [modernize-use-nullptr]
        if (data[i] == 0) {
                        ^
```

These warnings suggest using safer coding practices, such as avoiding pointer arithmetic and preferring `nullptr` over `0`.

- `-j4`: Uses 4 threads for analysis.

##### Reviewing Results

PVS-Studio provides detailed reports with categorized issues, severity levels, and suggested fixes. The reports can be viewed in its GUI or exported to various formats.

#### 8.3.6. Checking for MISRA Compliance

The MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association) guidelines are widely adopted in industries where safety and reliability are critical. Many static analysis tools support checking for MISRA compliance.

##### Configuring Tools for MISRA

Both Cppcheck and Clang-Tidy can be configured to check for MISRA compliance by enabling the appropriate checks.

```sh
cppcheck --enable=misra path/to/your/code
```

```sh
clang-tidy -checks='misra-*' path/to/your/code.cpp -- -std=c++11
```

##### Example Compliance Check

Consider the following C++ code:

```cpp
// misra_example.cpp
#include <iostream>

void dangerousFunction(int* ptr) {
    if (ptr == 0) { // Non-compliant: should use nullptr
        std::cout << "Null pointer detected" << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int* p = 0; // Non-compliant: should use nullptr
    dangerousFunction(p);
    return 0;
}
```

Running a MISRA compliance check might produce output like:

```plaintext
misra_example.cpp:4:19: [MISRA C++ Rule 5-0-15] Null pointer constant should be nullptr
misra_example.cpp:9:10: [MISRA C++ Rule 5-0-15] Null pointer constant should be nullptr
```

These messages indicate where the code violates MISRA guidelines and suggest compliant alternatives.

#### 8.3.7. Best Practices for Static Code Analysis

- **Integrate into CI Pipeline**: Run static analysis as part of your continuous integration (CI) pipeline to catch issues early.
- **Review and Address Issues Regularly**: Regularly review static analysis reports and address identified issues promptly.

- **Combine Tools**: Use multiple static analysis tools to leverage their unique strengths and catch a wider range of issues.
- **Educate Your Team**: Ensure that all team members understand the importance of static code analysis and know how to interpret and address the results.

By incorporating static code analysis into your development workflow, you can significantly improve the quality, security, and maintainability of your embedded C++ applications.

### 8.4. Profiling and Performance Tuning

Profiling and performance tuning are essential practices in the development of embedded systems to ensure that applications run efficiently within the constraints of limited resources. This subchapter explores various techniques and tools for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing embedded C++ applications.

#### 8.4.1. Importance of Profiling and Performance Tuning

In embedded systems, where memory, processing power, and energy are limited, optimizing performance is crucial. Benefits of profiling and performance tuning include:

- **Improved Responsiveness**: Ensuring timely responses in real-time systems.
- **Extended Battery Life**: Reducing power consumption in battery-operated devices.
- **Optimized Resource Utilization**: Efficiently using CPU, memory, and other resources.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Providing smoother and more reliable operation.

#### 8.4.2. Profiling Techniques

Profiling involves measuring various aspects of a program's execution to identify performance bottlenecks. Common profiling techniques include:

- **Time Profiling**: Measuring the time spent in different parts of the code.
- **Memory Profiling**: Tracking memory allocation and deallocation to identify leaks and inefficiencies.
- **Energy Profiling**: Measuring power consumption to optimize energy usage.

#### 8.4.3. Time Profiling

Time profiling helps identify functions or code sections that consume the most CPU time. Tools like `gprof`, `OProfile`, and `Arm DS-5 Streamline` are commonly used for time profiling.

##### Using gprof

`gprof` is a GNU profiler that analyzes program performance. Here’s how to use it with an embedded C++ application:

1. **Compile with Profiling Enabled**:

```sh
g++ -pg -o my_program my_program.cpp
```

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the program to generate profiling data.

```sh
./my_program
```

3. **Analyze the Profiling Data**:

```sh
gprof my_program gmon.out > analysis.txt
```

The output will show which functions consume the most time, helping you focus optimization efforts.

##### Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void heavyComputation() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
        // Simulate heavy computation
    }
}

void lightComputation() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        // Simulate light computation
    }
}

int main() {
    heavyComputation();
    lightComputation();
    return 0;
}
```

Running `gprof` on this code will show that `heavyComputation` consumes significantly more time than `lightComputation`.

#### 8.4.4. Memory Profiling

Memory profiling is crucial for identifying memory leaks and inefficient memory usage. Tools like `Valgrind`, `mtrace`, and `Arm DS-5` help with memory profiling.

##### Using Valgrind

Valgrind's `memcheck` tool detects memory leaks, illegal memory accesses, and other memory-related issues.

1. **Install Valgrind**:

```sh
sudo apt-get install valgrind
```

2. **Run the Program with Valgrind**:

```sh
valgrind --leak-check=full ./my_program
```

The output will detail memory leaks and illegal accesses.

##### Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void memoryLeak() {
    int* leak = new int[100]; // Memory leak: not deleted
}

int main() {
    memoryLeak();
    return 0;
}
```

Running Valgrind on this code will detect the memory leak in `memoryLeak`.

#### 8.4.5. Energy Profiling

Energy profiling is essential for battery-operated embedded systems. Tools like `PowerTOP` and `Intel VTune` can help measure and optimize power consumption.

##### Using PowerTOP

PowerTOP is a Linux tool for diagnosing issues with power consumption.

1. **Install PowerTOP**:

```sh
sudo apt-get install powertop
```

2. **Run PowerTOP**:

```sh
sudo powertop
```

PowerTOP provides an interactive interface showing power consumption details, including suggestions for reducing power usage.

##### Example Scenario

Consider an embedded device performing frequent sensor readings. By profiling energy consumption, you might find that the CPU stays active between readings, consuming unnecessary power. Introducing sleep modes or reducing the frequency of sensor readings can save energy.

#### 8.4.6. Performance Tuning Strategies

Once bottlenecks are identified, various strategies can be employed to optimize performance.

##### Code Optimization

Optimizing code involves improving algorithm efficiency and reducing unnecessary computations.

- **Use Efficient Algorithms**: Replace inefficient algorithms with more efficient ones (e.g., using quicksort instead of bubblesort).
- **Optimize Loops**: Minimize the work done inside loops and reduce the number of loop iterations.

Example:

```cpp
#include <vector>

// Inefficient
int sumArray(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

// Optimized
int sumArrayOptimized(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int value : arr) {
        sum += value;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

##### Memory Optimization

Optimizing memory usage involves reducing memory footprint and improving memory access patterns.

- **Avoid Memory Leaks**: Ensure all dynamically allocated memory is properly deallocated.
- **Use Stack Memory**: Prefer stack allocation over heap allocation for small objects to avoid heap fragmentation.

Example:

```cpp
#include <vector>

// Heap allocation
void processHeap() {
    std::vector<int>* data = new std::vector<int>(1000);
    // Process data
    delete data;
}

// Stack allocation
void processStack() {
    std::vector<int> data(1000);
    // Process data
}
```

##### Power Optimization

Optimizing power usage involves minimizing active power consumption and efficiently using low-power modes.

- **Use Sleep Modes**: Put the CPU and peripherals into sleep modes when not in use.
- **Reduce Peripheral Usage**: Disable or reduce the frequency of peripherals when not needed.

Example:

```cpp
#include "mbed.h"

DigitalOut led(LED1);

int main() {
    while (true) {
        led = !led;
        ThisThread::sleep_for(1000ms); // Put CPU to sleep for 1 second
    }
}
```

#### 8.4.7. Tools for Performance Tuning

Various tools can assist in performance tuning embedded systems:

- **Arm DS-5**: Comprehensive toolchain for profiling and debugging embedded systems.
- **Segger J-Scope**: Real-time data visualization tool.
- **ETM (Embedded Trace Macrocell)**: Provides detailed trace information for ARM processors.

##### Example with Arm DS-5

1. **Set Up DS-5**: Install Arm DS-5 and configure it for your target hardware.
2. **Profile the Application**: Use the built-in profiler to analyze time, memory, and power usage.
3. **Analyze Results**: Review the profiling results to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

#### 8.4.8. Best Practices for Profiling and Performance Tuning

- **Profile Early and Often**: Regular profiling helps catch performance issues early.
- **Focus on Hotspots**: Concentrate optimization efforts on the most time-consuming parts of the code.
- **Use Appropriate Tools**: Choose the right tools for the type of profiling you need (time, memory, energy).
- **Balance Performance and Readability**: Ensure that optimizations do not excessively compromise code readability and maintainability.
- **Document Changes**: Keep detailed records of optimizations and their impact on performance.

By systematically profiling and tuning the performance of your embedded C++ applications, you can ensure they run efficiently, reliably, and within the constraints of your target hardware.
