## 16. Practical Examples and Case Studies

In this chapter, we transition from theoretical concepts and delve into practical implementations to illustrate how process and memory management in Linux are applied in real-world scenarios. By examining case studies, such as the management of processes in a web server environment and the intricacies of memory handling in a database system, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of these mechanisms in action. Additionally, hands-on examples and exercises will solidify your comprehension, enabling you to apply these principles in your own projects. Through these practical applications, you'll gain invaluable insights and the confidence to manage and optimize processes and memory in various Linux-based systems.

### Case Study: Process Management in a Web Server

Process management is a fundamental concept in operating systems, particularly in Linux, where processes represent the executing instances of programs. Effective process management is crucial for the performance and reliability of web servers, which must handle a high volume of concurrent requests. This chapter dissects the process management techniques used in web servers, exploring both historical and modern approaches. We shall focus on popular web servers like Apache and Nginx to illustrate these concepts.

#### Introduction

Web servers are software applications that serve web pages to clients over the HTTP protocol. They must handle multiple client connections simultaneously, making efficient process management essential. Two primary models of process management in web servers are the multi-process model and the multi-threaded model. We'll explore each in turn and discuss their pros and cons from a performance and reliability perspective.

#### Historical Context

The earliest web servers, developed in the 1990s, primarily used a simple process creation approach. Every request spawned a new process. Although this model was straightforward to implement, it quickly became inefficient due to the significant overhead associated with constantly creating and terminating processes. 

#### Modern Implementations

##### The Multi-Process Model: Apache HTTP Server

The Apache HTTP Server, one of the most popular and venerable web servers, initially used a straightforward fork-per-request model which was later refined into the multi-process model. In its most common configuration, the pre-forking model, Apache pre-creates a pool of child processes that handle incoming requests.

###### Apache HTTP Server Process Management

In the pre-forking model, Apache starts with a parent process that spawns a fixed number of child processes at startup. Each child process can handle a certain number of requests before it is terminated and replaced by a new child process. This approach mitigates the overhead of constantly creating new processes while still providing robustness and reliability.

**Configuration Example:**
```apache
<IfModule mpm_prefork_module>
    StartServers          5
    MinSpareServers       5
    MaxSpareServers      10
    MaxRequestWorkers   150
    MaxConnectionsPerChild  1000
</IfModule>
```

This configuration snippet defines the number of initial servers (`StartServers`), the minimum and maximum spare servers, the total number of worker processes (`MaxRequestWorkers`), and the maximum number of requests a child process can handle before being replaced (`MaxConnectionsPerChild`).

**Advantages:**
1. **Stability:** Isolating each request in a separate process enhances stability, as crashing one process does not affect others.
2. **Security:** Process isolation can improve security since compromising one process does not give access to the memory or resources of another.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **High Memory Usage:** Each process consumes separate memory, leading to higher overall memory usage.
2. **Context Switching Overhead:** Frequent context switches between processes can degrade performance.

##### The Multi-Threaded Model: Nginx

Nginx, designed to address the performance limitations of the pre-forking model, employs an event-driven, asynchronous architecture. Unlike Apache, Nginx uses a single-threaded, non-blocking, and highly optimized model to handle multiple connections within a single process. 

###### Nginx Process Management

Nginx uses a master-worker model, where the master process controls several worker processes. Each worker process can handle thousands of concurrent connections using asynchronous I/O.

**Configuration Example:**
```nginx
worker_processes 4;  # Adjust based on the number of CPU cores
events {
    worker_connections 1024;  # Maximum number of connections per worker
}
```

This configuration defines the number of worker processes and the number of connections each worker can manage. Nginx's architecture allows each worker process to handle numerous connections concurrently by efficiently using event-driven mechanisms like `epoll` (on Linux).

**Advantages:**
1. **High Performance:** Nginx can handle a large number of concurrent connections with fewer system resources due to its event-driven nature.
2. **Scalability:** The asynchronous model allows for better scalability with minimal overhead.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Complexity:** The asynchronous model can be more complex to implement and debug.
2. **Single Threaded Limitation:** If not properly configured, a single slow connection can block others since all connections are handled in a single thread.

#### Hybrid Models

Some modern web servers combine aspects of both models to balance performance and reliability. For example, Apache with the `mpm_worker` module uses a hybrid approach with multiple threads within each child process. This allows for the memory efficiency of threads and the stability of processes.

**Configuration Example:**
```apache
<IfModule mpm_worker_module>
    StartServers          2
    MinSpareThreads      25
    MaxSpareThreads      75
    ThreadsPerChild      25
    MaxRequestWorkers   150
    MaxConnectionsPerChild   0
</IfModule>
```

In this configuration, each child process can spawn multiple threads, allowing for efficient utilization of system resources.

#### Kernel and User-Space Interactions

To fully grasp web server process management, we must understand the Linux kernel's role in handling processes and threads. The kernel provides several system calls and interfaces for process and thread management, such as `fork()`, `exec()`, `clone()`, and `pthread_create()`.

**System Calls Overview:**

1. `fork()`: Creates a new process by duplicating the current process. It returns the process ID of the child process to the parent.

```c++
pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) {
    // Child process
    // Execute code for child process
} else if (pid > 0) {
    // Parent process
    // Execute code for parent process
} else {
    // Fork failed
    perror("fork");
}
```

2. `exec()`: Replaces the current process image with a new process image. It is often used in combination with `fork()` to start a new program.

```c++
if (pid == 0) {
    // Child process
    execl("/bin/ls", "ls", (char *)NULL);
    // This line only executes if execl fails
    perror("execl");
    exit(1);
}
```

3. `clone()`: Allows fine-grained control over what is shared between the parent and child process. Used internally by thread libraries (Pthreads).

4. `pthread_create()`: Creates a new thread within the process. This is a user-space function provided by the Pthreads library.

```c++
pthread_t thread;
int result = pthread_create(&thread, NULL, thread_function, (void *)arg);
if (result != 0) {
    perror("pthread_create");
}
```

**Event-Driven and Asynchronous I/O:**

Nginx and other event-driven servers heavily utilize kernel mechanisms like `epoll`, `kqueue`, and `select`:

1. **epoll**: Efficiently manages a large number of file descriptors for I/O operations.

```c++
int epoll_fd = epoll_create1(0);
if (epoll_fd == -1) {
    perror("epoll_create1");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

struct epoll_event event;
event.events = EPOLLIN;  // Interested in read events
event.data.fd = listen_fd;
if (epoll_ctl(epoll_fd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, listen_fd, &event) == -1) {
    perror("epoll_ctl");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

2. **io_uring**: A newer interface that provides more efficient asynchronous I/O operations, introduced in recent Linux kernel versions.

Nginx’s event loop continuously monitors file descriptors to see if they are ready for reading or writing, thereby avoiding the inefficiency of blocking operations.

#### Performance Comparison and Tuning

A detailed performance comparison between Apache (pre-fork and hybrid models) and Nginx (event-driven model) reveals different strengths. Apache performs better under lower loads with fewer connections but tends to degrade as the number of connections increases. Conversely, Nginx excels at handling a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

**Performance Tuning Tips:**

1. **Apache Pre-Fork**:
   - Increase the `MaxRequestWorkers` and `ServerLimit` settings to handle more simultaneous connections.
   - Optimize `KeepAliveTimeout` and `MaxKeepAliveRequests` for the expected load.

2. **Nginx**:
   - Adjust `worker_processes` to match the number of CPU cores.
   - Set `worker_connections` to a high value to manage numerous concurrent connections.

#### Security Considerations

Web servers operate on the front line of defense in network security. Effective process management contributes to security in several ways:

1. **Isolation**: Isolating requests in separate processes (Apache pre-fork) limits the impact of compromised processes.
2. **Least Privilege**: Running worker processes with minimal privileges reduces potential damage from exploits.
3. **Resource Limits**: Configuring resource limits (using `ulimit` in Linux) prevents any single process from monopolizing system resources.

#### Conclusion

Process management in web servers is a critical aspect that impacts performance, reliability, scalability, and security. Understanding the differences between the multi-process and multi-threaded models, as well as their implementations in Apache and Nginx, provides valuable insights into their behavior under different loads and conditions. By leveraging appropriate kernel interfaces and tuning configurations, system administrators and developers can optimize web server performance to meet their specific needs. This deep understanding of process management principles is not only essential for running efficient web servers but also provides a foundation for addressing broader performance and resource management challenges in Linux systems.

### Case Study: Memory Management in a Database System 

Memory management is a cornerstone of database system performance and reliability. In Linux, effective memory management ensures that databases can handle large volumes of data and numerous simultaneous queries efficiently. This chapter delves into the sophisticated memory management techniques employed by modern database systems, using prominent examples such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. We will examine their memory architectures, allocation strategies, and tuning methodologies with a scientific lens to understand how they optimize memory usage.

#### Introduction

Databases are intensive memory consumers due to the need to process, store, and quickly retrieve vast quantities of data. Proper memory management significantly impacts database performance, affecting query response times, transaction throughput, and overall system scalability. Modern database systems leverage a combination of operating system memory management facilities and their internal memory management techniques to ensure optimal performance.

#### Memory Architecture in Database Systems

Databases typically utilize a combination of volatile (RAM) and non-volatile (disk) memory to store and manage data. The primary memory management components in a database system include:

1. **Buffer Pool or Cache**: A critical component where frequently accessed data and metadata are stored to minimize disk I/O operations.
2. **Sort and Join Memory**: Temporary areas used for sorting operations, joins, and other query processing mechanisms.
3. **Lock and Transaction Management Memory**: Allocated for managing locks, transactions, and other concurrency control mechanisms.
4. **Connection Memory**: Used for handling client connections and their associated states.

#### Buffer Pool Management

The buffer pool (or buffer cache) is the heart of a database system's memory management. It acts as an intermediary between the disk storage and the CPU, caching frequently accessed data pages to reduce costly disk I/O operations. The effectiveness of the buffer pool directly influences the throughput and latency of database operations.

##### MySQL InnoDB Buffer Pool

MySQL's InnoDB storage engine uses a sophisticated buffer pool to manage memory. The buffer pool is divided into pages, which are the basic units of storage. Pages can contain data, indexes, or internal metadata.

**Configuration Example:**
```ini
[mysqld]
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G
innodb_buffer_pool_instances = 4
innodb_page_size = 16k
```

In this configuration, `innodb_buffer_pool_size` sets the total size of the buffer pool, while `innodb_buffer_pool_instances` splits it into multiple instances for better concurrency on multi-core systems.

**LRU (Least Recently Used) Algorithm:**

InnoDB uses a variant of the LRU algorithm to manage the buffer pool. The LRU list maintains pages such that the least recently used pages are evicted first when space is needed. However, to mitigate "midpoint insertion," InnoDB divides the LRU list into young and old sublists, allowing freshly read pages to be initially inserted into the midpoint.

**Dirty Page Management:**

Pages that have been modified (dirty pages) must be flushed to disk to ensure durability. InnoDB uses background threads to manage this flushing process, balancing between minimizing I/O overhead and maintaining data integrity.

##### PostgreSQL Shared Buffer

PostgreSQL’s approach to buffer management involves the shared buffer pool, managed similarly to InnoDB’s buffer pool but with some key differences.

**Configuration Example:**
```ini
shared_buffers = 2GB
effective_cache_size = 6GB
```

The `shared_buffers` parameter defines the size of PostgreSQL’s buffer pool. The `effective_cache_size` parameter is an estimate of how much memory is available for disk caching by the operating system, influencing query planner decisions.

**Buffer Replacement Strategies:**

PostgreSQL employs a combination of clock-sweep and LRU strategies to manage its buffer pool. The clock-sweep algorithm is a form of approximate LRU, where a pointer sweeps through the buffer pool, giving pages a chance to be accessed before being evicted.

#### Sort and Join Memory

Complex queries often require sorting and joining large sets of data, necessitating efficient memory management strategies.

##### MySQL Sort Buffer

MySQL provides a sort buffer for each thread to perform sorting operations. This buffer becomes crucial when sorting large result sets that cannot fit into memory.

**Configuration Example:**
```ini
sort_buffer_size = 8MB
```

##### PostgreSQL Work Memory

PostgreSQL uses the `work_mem` configuration parameter to define the amount of memory allocated for internal sort operations and hash tables for joins.

**Configuration Example:**
```ini
work_mem = 64MB
```

Properly tuning `sort_buffer_size` and `work_mem` can significantly impact performance, especially for complex queries that require extensive sorting and joining.

#### Lock and Transaction Management Memory

Database systems employ intricate locking mechanisms to ensure data consistency and integrity in multi-user environments. Efficient memory allocation for these mechanisms helps in reducing contention and improving concurrency.

##### MySQL InnoDB Locks

InnoDB uses various types of locks (e.g., shared, exclusive) and maintains them in memory structures like lock tables.

**Configuration Example:**
```ini
innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 50
```

##### PostgreSQL Lock Management

PostgreSQL also handles locks dynamically, allocating memory as needed to manage lock states and ensure seamless transaction processing.

**Configuration Example:**
```ini
max_locks_per_transaction = 64
```

Increasing `max_locks_per_transaction` allows for handling more extensive transactions but requires careful consideration of the additional memory overhead.

#### Connection Memory Management

Handling client connections is another area where efficient memory management is critical. Each connection consumes memory for session state, query processing, and result buffering.

##### MySQL Thread Cache

MySQL uses thread caching to manage connections efficiently.

**Configuration Example:**
```ini
thread_cache_size = 16
```

The `thread_cache_size` parameter ensures that threads are reused rather than recreated for each connection, improving performance by reducing overhead.

##### PostgreSQL Connection Management

PostgreSQL uses a process-based model where each connection is handled by a separate process.

**Configuration Example:**
```ini
max_connections = 100
```

The `max_connections` parameter sets the maximum number of concurrent connections. Adequate memory must be available to handle all configured connections without degrading performance.

#### Interaction with the Linux Kernel

Effective memory management in database systems also involves interactions with the Linux kernel. Database systems rely on several kernel-level mechanisms to manage memory, including:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `malloc()` and `free()` for dynamic memory requests.
2. **Shared Memory Segments**: Leveraging `shmget()`, `shmat()`, and similar system calls to create and attach to shared memory segments.

**Shared Memory Example in C++:**
```c++
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
    // Creating a unique key for shared memory segment
    key_t key = ftok("shmfile", 65);

    // Create a shared memory segment
    int shmid = shmget(key, 1024, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);

    // Attach to shared memory
    char *str = (char *) shmat(shmid, (void *) 0, 0);

    // Write to shared memory
    strcpy(str, "Hello World");

    // Detach from shared memory
    shmdt(str);

    // Destroy the shared memory segment
    shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Kernel Memory Management Facilities

Databases also benefit from kernel-level memory management features like:

1. **Huge Pages**: Helps in reducing the performance overhead of TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) misses by using larger memory pages.
2. **NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)**: Optimizes memory access patterns on multi-processor systems to reduce latency.

**Configuration Example for Huge Pages in PostgreSQL:**
```ini
huge_pages = try
```

#### Performance Tuning and Monitoring

The effectiveness of memory management strategies can be gauged through continuous monitoring and tuning.

##### Monitoring Tools

1. **Performance Schema (MySQL)**: Provides insights into memory usage and performance metrics.
2. **pg_stat_activity (PostgreSQL)**: Details active queries, memory usage, and session statistics.

**Example Query to Monitor Memory in PostgreSQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
```

##### Tuning Strategies

1. **Buffer Pool Tuning**: Use workload-specific benchmarks to adjust buffer pool sizes.
2. **Sort and Join Memory Allocation**: Monitor query performance to fine-tune sort and join memory settings.
3. **Lock Memory Management**: Optimize transaction and lock settings to balance memory usage and concurrency.

1. **Connection Pooling**: Using connection pools (e.g., PgPool-II for PostgreSQL) to manage and reuse database connections efficiently.

#### Conclusion

Memory management in database systems is a complex but vital aspect that encompasses various components such as buffer pools, transaction memory, sorting and joining memory, and connection handling. By employing sophisticated memory management techniques and leveraging kernel facilities, modern databases ensure they provide high performance, scalability, and robustness. Understanding these mechanisms and their impact allows database administrators and developers to optimize configurations, ensuring efficient memory utilization and exceptional system performance.

### Practical Examples and Exercises

Understanding the theoretical aspects of process and memory management is crucial, but applying this knowledge in practical scenarios solidifies comprehension and prepares you for real-world challenges. In this chapter, we will delve into practical examples and exercises that illustrate key concepts. These exercises are designed to be detailed and rigorous, providing a deep dive into practical implementations. By the end of this chapter, you should have a strong grasp of how to handle various situations involving process and memory management in a Linux environment.

#### Example 1: Managing Processes with Fork and Exec

Creating and managing processes are fundamental tasks in Linux. The following example demonstrates how to use `fork` and `exec` system calls to create a new process and execute a different program within it.

**Scenario:**

You are developing a shell-like program that needs to execute user commands. You must create a new process for each command and run it, ensuring the parent process continues to operate.

**Solution:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <cstring>

void executeCommand(const char *command) {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("Fork failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        char *args[] = {(char *)command, (char *)nullptr};
        if (execvp(command, args) == -1) {
            perror("Exec failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    } else {
        // Parent process
        int status;
        waitpid(pid, &status, 0);
        if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
            std::cout << "Command executed with exit status: " << WEXITSTATUS(status) << std::endl;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    while (true) {
        std::cout << "shell> ";
        std::string command;
        std::getline(std::cin, command);
        if (command == "exit") break;
        executeCommand(command.c_str());
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Fork:** The `fork` system call creates a new process. The child process gets an identical copy of the parent’s address space.
2. **Exec:** After forking, the child process uses `execvp` to replace its address space with the new program specified by `command`.
3. **Wait:** The parent process waits for the child to complete using `waitpid`.

**Exercise:**

Modify the above program to handle multiple arguments for the command (e.g., `ls -l /home`).

#### Example 2: Memory Allocation and Management

Memory management involves allocation, usage, and deallocation of memory during a program’s execution. This example demonstrates dynamic memory allocation and its management.

**Scenario:**

You need to create a dynamic array that grows as more elements are added. The solution should efficiently manage memory to minimize reallocations.

**Solution:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <cstring>

class DynamicArray {
private:
    int *array;
    size_t capacity;
    size_t used;

    void resize() {
        capacity *= 2;
        int *new_array = new int[capacity];
        std::memcpy(new_array, array, used * sizeof(int));
        delete[] array;
        array = new_array;
    }

public:
    DynamicArray(size_t initial_capacity = 16)
        : array(new int[initial_capacity]), capacity(initial_capacity), used(0) {}

    ~DynamicArray() {
        delete[] array;
    }

    void add(int value) {
        if (used == capacity) {
            resize();
        }
        array[used++] = value;
    }

    size_t size() const {
        return used;
    }

    int operator[](size_t index) const {
        if (index >= used) throw std::out_of_range("Index out of bounds");
        return array[index];
    }
};

int main() {
    DynamicArray arr;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        arr.add(i);
    }
    for (size_t i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dynamic Allocation:** The `new` keyword dynamically allocates memory on the heap.
2. **Resizing:** The `resize` method doubles the array’s capacity when more space is needed. `std::memcpy` is used to copy the old data to the new array.
3. **Destructor:** Ensures that the dynamically allocated memory is deallocated to avoid memory leaks.

**Exercise:**

Implement a `remove` function that removes an element at a given index and shifts the remaining elements to fill the gap.

#### Example 3: Memory Pools

Memory pools can provide faster, more efficient memory allocation and deallocation compared to general-purpose allocators. This example demonstrates a simple memory pool implementation.

**Scenario:**

You are optimizing an application with frequent small, fixed-size memory allocations. A custom memory pool can significantly reduce allocation overhead and fragmentation.

**Solution:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

class MemoryPool {
private:
    struct Block {
        Block* next;
    };

    Block* freeList;
    std::vector<void*> chunks;
    const size_t blockSize;
    const size_t blockCount;

public:
    MemoryPool(size_t blockSize, size_t blockCount)
        : freeList(nullptr), blockSize(blockSize), blockCount(blockCount) {
            expandPool();
        }

    ~MemoryPool() {
        for (void* chunk : chunks) {
            operator delete(chunk);
        }
    }

    void* allocate() {
        if (!freeList) {
            expandPool();
        }
        Block* block = freeList;
        freeList = freeList->next;
        return block;
    }

    void deallocate(void* ptr) {
        Block* block = static_cast<Block*>(ptr);
        block->next = freeList;
        freeList = block;
    }

private:
    void expandPool() {
        size_t size = blockSize * blockCount;
        void* chunk = operator new(size);
        chunks.push_back(chunk);

        for (size_t i = 0; i < blockCount; ++i) {
            void* ptr = static_cast<char*>(chunk) + i * blockSize;
            deallocate(ptr);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    MemoryPool pool(sizeof(int), 10);

    std::vector<void*> allocatedBlocks;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        void* ptr = pool.allocate();
        allocatedBlocks.push_back(ptr);
        new(ptr) int(i); // Construct an integer in allocated memory
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        void* ptr = allocatedBlocks[i];
        std::cout << *static_cast<int*>(ptr) << " ";
        static_cast<int*>(ptr)->~int(); // Destructor
        pool.deallocate(ptr);
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Block Structure:** The `Block` struct forms the linked free list.
2. **Free List Management:** The `allocate` and `deallocate` methods manage the allocation and reclamation of blocks.
3. **Memory Expansion:** When the pool is exhausted, `expandPool` allocates new memory and refills the free list.

**Exercise:**

Modify the memory pool to handle different block sizes using a template class. Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent memory corruption.

#### Example 4: Exploring Linux Kernel Memory Management

Linux employs mechanisms such as the page cache and virtual memory to manage memory efficiently. This example demonstrates reading from the `/proc` filesystem to gather memory statistics.

**Scenario:**

As a system administrator, you need to monitor memory usage and identify potential issues with memory allocation or fragmentation.

**Solution:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>

struct MemoryInfo {
    std::string key;
    long value;
    std::string unit;

    MemoryInfo(const std::string &line) {
        std::istringstream iss(line);
        iss >> key >> value >> unit;
    }

    void print() const {
        std::cout << key << ": " << value << " " << unit << std::endl;

std::vector<MemoryInfo> getMemoryInfo() {
    std::ifstream file("/proc/meminfo");
    if (!file.is_open()) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Could not open /proc/meminfo");
    }

    std::vector<MemoryInfo> memoryInfo;

**Explanation:**

1. **/proc/meminfo:** The `/proc/meminfo` file provides detailed memory statistics maintained by the Linux kernel.
2. **Parsing:** The `MemoryInfo` struct parses each line into a key, value, and unit.
3. **Memory Monitoring:** By reading and parsing `/proc/meminfo`, we gather vital statistics like total memory, free memory, and buffer/cache.

**Exercise:**

Expand this program to monitor other critical system statistics such as CPU usage and I/O statistics from `/proc/stat` and `/proc/diskstats`.

#### Example 5: Handling Memory Pressure with Cgroups

Control groups (cgroups) allow for fine-grained resource control in Linux. This example demonstrates setting up cgroups to limit memory usage of a specific process.

**Scenario:**

You need to isolate a resource-hungry application to prevent it from consuming too much memory and affecting other applications' performance.

**Solution:**

1. **Create and Configure Cgroup:**

```bash
sudo cgcreate -g memory:/limited_memory
echo 512M | sudo tee /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/limited_memory/memory.limit_in_bytes
```

2. **Start Process in Cgroup:**

```bash
sudo cgexec -g memory:limited_memory ./your_application
```

**Explanation:**

1. **cgcreate:** The command creates a new cgroup called `limited_memory` under the `memory` namespace.
2. **Setting Memory Limit:** The `memory.limit_in_bytes` parameter restricts the memory usage to 512 MB.
3. **cgexec:** Executes the application within the specified cgroup, enforcing the memory constraints.

**Exercise:**

Write a C++ program that dynamically adjusts memory limits based on current usage statistics. This program should use cgroup interfaces to read and modify the memory limits.
