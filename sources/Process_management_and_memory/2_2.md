## 5. System Calls for Process Management

In this chapter, we delve into the core mechanisms that Linux provides for process management through system calls. These system calls are the fundamental tools that allow the kernel and user-space applications to interact efficiently, creating and controlling processes. We will explore the `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()` system calls, which are pivotal for process creation and execution. By understanding these calls, you will gain insight into how new processes are spawned, how they are replaced with different programs, and how the parent processes can synchronize and manage child processes effectively. This knowledge is crucial for both system programmers and application developers who need to orchestrate multiple processes within their software. With practical examples and detailed explanations, we will unlock the mechanisms behind these vital system calls, enabling you to harness the full potential of process management in Linux.

### Fork, Exec, and Wait System Calls

#### Introduction

In the Linux operating system, process management is an intricate and highly optimized component that facilitates the running of multiple processes concurrently. Central to this paradigm are three fundamental system calls: `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`. These system calls provide robust mechanisms for process creation, execution of new programs, and synchronization between processes.

Understanding these calls is crucial for both system programmers who need to interact directly with the kernel and software developers aiming to efficiently manage multiple tasks within their applications. This chapter delves deeply into the intricacies of these system calls, providing a comprehensive understanding needed for advanced Linux programming.

#### The `fork()` System Call

**Purpose and Functionality**

The `fork()` system call is used to create a new process, which is called the child process. The process that initiates the `fork()` is termed the parent process. The new child process is a duplicate of the parent process, albeit with its own unique process identifier (PID).

On successful completion, `fork()` returns the PID of the child process to the parent, and 0 to the newly created child process. If an error occurs, it returns -1 to the parent process, and no child process is created.

**Mechanics of `fork()`**

1. **Process Table Entry Duplication:** The kernel creates an entry in the process table for the child process, copying most attributes from the parent, including file descriptors, environment, and program counter.
2. **Copy-On-Write (COW):** Memory is not immediately duplicated. Instead, pages in memory are marked as copy-on-write, meaning physical copies are made only when either process modifies them.
3. **Scheduling:** The new process is added to the scheduler, ready to be executed.

**Example Code:**
```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Fork failed\n");
        return 1;
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child process: PID = %d\n", getpid());
    } else {
        printf("Parent process: PID = %d, Child PID = %d\n", getpid(), pid);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In the example, `fork()` is called to create a child process. The parent and child processes execute separately, distinguishing their execution paths based on the return value of `fork()`.

#### The `exec()` Family of System Calls

**Purpose and Functionality**

The `exec()` family of functions replaces the current process image with a new one. This is a crucial concept in Unix-like operating systems, enabling the execution of different programs within the context of an existing process.

There are several variations of the `exec()` call, including `execl()`, `execle()`, `execlp()`, `execv()`, `execvp()`, and `execve()`. These variations allow the programmer to pass the path of the executable and the arguments in different formats.

**Mechanics of `exec()`**

1. **Loading the New Program:** The program specified in the `exec` call is loaded into the address space of the current process.
2. **Replacing the Image:** The existing process image is replaced by the new one. This includes the program's code, data, heap, stack, and other memory regions.
3. **File Descriptors:** Open file descriptors are preserved across `exec()`, except those marked with the `FD_CLOEXEC` flag.
4. **No Return:** Upon successful execution, `exec()` does not return, as the original process image no longer exists. If it fails, it returns -1 and sets `errno`.

**Example Code:**
```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char *args[] = {"/bin/ls", "-l", NULL};
    if (execvp(args[0], args) < 0) {
        perror("execvp failed");
        return 1;
    }
    
    return 0; // This line will not be executed if execvp() succeeds
}
```

In this example, `execvp()` is used to replace the current program with the `ls` command. If successful, the current process executes `ls -l`. The call fails if the program path or execution fails.

#### The `wait()` System Call

**Purpose and Functionality**

The `wait()` system call is used by a process to wait for state changes in its child processes. This system call is essential for synchronizing process execution, ensuring that a parent process can perform cleanup and receive the child's exit status.

**Types of `wait` Variations**

1. **`wait()`:** Suspends the calling process until one of its children exits or a signal is received.
2. **`waitpid()`:** Provides more control by allowing the caller to wait for a specific PID or a set of PIDs.
3. **`waitid()`:** Provides additional options for specifying which child processes to wait for and how to behave upon state changes.

**Mechanics of `wait()`**

1. **Suspending the Parent:** The parent process is suspended until a child process terminates or a signal is received.
2. **Child Termination:** When a child terminates, its termination status and resource usage are reported to the parent.
3. **Cleaning up the Zombie Process:** The terminated child process is cleaned up, removing its entry from the process table and freeing up resources.

**Example Code:**
```cpp
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process: PID = %d\n", getpid());
        sleep(2); // Simulate some work
        return 42; // Exit with a status code
    } else {
        // Parent process
        int status;
        pid_t child_pid = wait(&status);

        if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
            printf("Parent process: Child PID = %d, exited with status = %d\n",
                   child_pid, WEXITSTATUS(status));
        } else {
            printf("Parent process: Child process did not exit successfully\n");
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the parent process calls `wait()` to wait for the child process to terminate. Once the child process exits, the parent retrieves the child's exit status using the `WIFEXITED()` and `WEXITSTATUS()` macros.

#### Advanced Topics

**Concurrency and Synchronization**

When dealing with multiple processes, understanding concurrency and ensuring proper synchronization is critical. Using the `wait()` family of calls ensures that parent processes can track and manage child processes effectively, avoiding issues such as zombies or orphaned processes.

**Handling Signals**

Signal handling in the context of these system calls is another advanced topic. Processes can receive signals, affecting the behavior of `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`. Proper signal handling ensures robust and predictable process management.

**Performance Considerations**

Efficient memory management and resource allocation are essential for performance. The Copy-On-Write mechanism in `fork()` helps reduce overhead by delaying memory duplication until necessary. Understanding and leveraging these performance optimizations can lead to more efficient and responsive applications.

#### Summary

The `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()` system calls are the cornerstones of process management in Linux. `fork()` creates new processes, `exec()` replaces the process's memory space with a new program, and `wait()` synchronizes the parent with its child processes. Together, they provide a powerful and flexible API for process control, enabling complex multitasking and resource management strategies.

By mastering these system calls, you gain the ability to efficiently manage processes within Linux, a skill crucial for developing advanced system-level and application software. Whether you're writing a multi-process server or optimizing application performance, a deep understanding of these system calls is indispensable.

### Creating and Executing New Processes

#### Introduction

The creation and execution of new processes is fundamental to the multitasking capabilities of Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The precise mechanisms by which processes are created, their execution images are replaced, and how they interact with their environments form the backbone of effective process management. This chapter explores the technical and procedural aspects of process creation and execution, focusing on the interdependence between various system calls, memory management techniques, and Unix paradigms.

#### Overview of Process Lifecycle

When a process is created, it undergoes several well-defined stages from its inception to termination:

1. **Creation:** A new process is created by an existing process using the `fork()` system call.
2. **Initialization:** The newly created process inherits several attributes from its parent, such as environment variables, file descriptors, and memory space.
3. **Execution:** The child process may execute a new program using the `exec()` family of system calls.
4. **Synchronization and Termination:** The interactions between parent and child processes are managed using synchronization mechanisms like the `wait()` family of system calls, leading to the eventual termination of the child process.

#### Detailed Examination of `fork()`

The `fork()` system call is a critical mechanism for creating new processes. Here's an in-depth look at its functions and implications:

**1. Parent-Child Duplication:**

- **New Process Creation:** `fork()` creates a child process that is almost an exact duplicate of the parent process.
- **Attribute Inheritance:** The child process inherits the parent's open file descriptors, environment variables, and program counter. However, it receives a new unique process ID (PID).

**2. Resource Allocation:**

- **Memory Management:** Both parent and child processes share the same memory pages initially. Linux uses a Copy-On-Write (COW) technique to optimize memory usage, only duplicating pages when modifications are made.
- **File Descriptors:** File descriptor tables are copied, but both parent and child continue to share the same underlying open files.

**3. Execution Flow:**

- **Return Values:** `fork()` returns twice—once in the parent process with the child's PID and once in the child process with a return value of 0. This mechanism allows both processes to determine their execution paths post-fork.
- **Error Handling:** If `fork()` fails (typically due to resource limitations), it returns -1 in the parent process, and no child process is created.

#### Enhanced Process Execution with `exec()`

While `fork()` is responsible for creating a new process, `exec()` (and its variations) transforms that process to execute a new program. Here’s how:

**1. Program Loading:**

- **Replaces Process Image:** `exec()` replaces the current process image with a new program. This includes the text segment (code), data segment, heap, and stack segments.
- **Preserving State:** Some aspects of the process state are preserved, such as process ID, open file descriptors (except those set with `FD_CLOEXEC`), and certain signal handlers.

**2. Function Variants:**

- **`execl()`, `execv()`, `execle()`, `execlp()`, `execvp()`, `execve()`:** Each variant of `exec()` provides a different interface for passing arguments and environment variables.
    - **List vs. Vector:** The `l` and `v` variants differ in how arguments are passed (list vs. vector of strings).
    - **Path Search:** Variants ending in `p` use the `PATH` environment variable to search for the executable.
    - **Environment Variables:** Variants ending in `e` allow explicit setting of environment variables for the new program.

**3. No Return on Success:**

- Once a successful `exec()` call is made, the new program replaces the current process space, and execution continues from the new program's entry point. The original program’s instructions will not continue to execute past the point of the `exec()` call unless `exec()` fails.

#### Process Synchronization and Termination with `wait()`

After creating and possibly transforming a child process, a parent process often needs to synchronize with and manage its children. The `wait()` system call and its variants (`waitpid()`, `waitid()`) serve this purpose. Here’s a detailed look:

**1. Basic Synchronization:**

- **Blocking Call:** The `wait()` call blocks the parent process until a child process terminates, providing the parent with its termination status.
- **Termination Status:** The termination status includes whether the child terminated normally, was killed by a signal, or continued operations (e.g., was stopped by a `SIGSTOP` signal).

**2. Enhanced Control with `waitpid()`:**

- **Specific Child Targeting:** `waitpid()` allows the parent to wait for a specific child process identified by its PID.
- **Non-blocking Options:** Using the `WNOHANG` option, `waitpid()` can be non-blocking, allowing the parent to proceed without waiting for child termination.
- **Additional Flags:** Other flags, like `WUNTRACED` and `WCONTINUED`, allow the parent to handle stopped and continued child processes, respectively.

**3. Resource Cleanup:**

- **Reclaiming Resources:** When a child process terminates, the parent must call `wait()` or `waitpid()` to read its termination status. This step is crucial to prevent the child process from becoming a zombie (a defunct process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table).
- **Avoiding Orphans:** If a parent process dies before its child, `init` (PID 1) typically adopts the orphaned child process and is responsible for cleaning it up.

#### Practical Considerations and Advanced Topics

**1. Process Hierarchy and Orphan Management:**

Understanding the hierarchical structure of process creation is essential. When a parent terminates before its child, the system’s `init` process adopts the orphaned children. Proper management and cleanup of orphan processes are crucial to avoid resource leaks and ensure system stability.

**2. Process Group and Session Management:**

Linux processes are organized into process groups and sessions to facilitate job control and signal management in shells and terminal interfaces. Processes within a group can be managed together, receiving signals like `SIGINT` and `SIGTSTP` as a coordinated unit.

**3. Signal Handling in Process Lifecycle:**

Signals play a significant role in process management. They can interrupt system calls like `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`, introducing challenges that require careful handling. Custom signal handlers and robust signal masking techniques are often used to manage these interruptions gracefully.

**4. Performance Optimization:**

Creating and executing processes are computationally expensive operations. Optimizations like Copy-On-Write for memory management during `fork()` and efficient handling of file descriptors are vital for maintaining system performance. Developers often use these mechanisms thoughtfully, considering trade-offs between resource utilization and computational overhead.

Here's an advanced example illustrating the cooperation between `fork()`, `exec()`, and `waitpid()` with error handling and signal management:

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <signal.h>

void handle_signal(int signum) {
    // Custom signal handler for demonstration
    printf("Received signal %d\n", signum);
}

int main() {
    struct sigaction sa;
    sa.sa_handler = handle_signal;
    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
    sa.sa_flags = 0;

    if (sigaction(SIGCHLD, &sa, NULL) == -1) {
        perror("sigaction");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("fork failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process: Execute a new program
        char *args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};
        if (execvp(args[0], args) < 0) {
            perror("execvp failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    } else {
        // Parent process: Wait for the child to terminate
        int status;
        pid_t wait_pid = waitpid(pid, &status, 0);

        if (wait_pid == -1) {
            perror("waitpid failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
            printf("Child process exited with status = %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
        } else if (WIFSIGNALED(status)) {
            printf("Child process killed by signal %d\n", WTERMSIG(status));
        } else {
            printf("Child process did not terminate normally\n");
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we enhance the basic `fork`, `exec`, and `waitpid` workflow by adding signal handling. The `sigaction` setup ensures that the parent process is notified when the child process terminates, showcasing a more sophisticated approach to process management.

#### Conclusion

Creating and executing new processes in Linux is a multifaceted and complex task that lies at the heart of the operating system’s multitasking capabilities. By leveraging system calls such as `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`, developers can achieve a high degree of control over process management. These concepts are foundational for building robust, efficient, and responsive software on Unix-like systems. Understanding the nuances of these system calls, including their interaction with memory management mechanisms and their implications for system performance, is essential for any advanced Linux programmer or system developer.

### Monitoring and Controlling Processes

#### Introduction

The ability to monitor and control processes is pivotal for maintaining system stability, ensuring security, and optimizing performance in any Unix-like operating system, including Linux. This capability is fundamental for system administrators, developers, and any users managing multitasking environments. This chapter dives deeply into the techniques and tools available in Linux for process monitoring and control, understanding process states, resource usage, signals, and inter-process communication mechanisms.

#### Process Monitoring

Monitoring processes involves gathering information about the processes running on a system, such as their state, resource utilization, and interactions. Here are key tools and methods:

**1. /proc Filesystem:**

The `/proc` filesystem provides a rich set of information about system processes. It is a virtual filesystem dynamically generated by the kernel, offering real-time data about the state of the system and processes.

- **Process Directories:** Each running process has a directory named by its PID within `/proc` (e.g., `/proc/1234` for PID 1234). Within these directories are various files that provide detailed information about the process.
- **Important Files in /proc/[pid]:**
    - `/proc/[pid]/stat:` Contains status information about the process.
    - `/proc/[pid]/cmdline:` Shows the command-line arguments of the process.
    - `/proc/[pid]/status:` Provides human-readable status information.
    - `/proc/[pid]/fd:` Contains symbolic links to the file descriptors opened by the process.

**2. System Commands and Utilities:**

Several commands and utilities are available in Linux for monitoring processes:

- **ps:** The `ps` command provides a snapshot of the current processes. It can display various attributes like PID, process state, memory usage, etc.
- **top:** The `top` command offers a real-time view of system processes, sorted by resource usage.
- **htop:** An interactive process viewer similar to `top`, but with enhanced usability featuring color-coded information.
- **lsof:** Lists open files and the processes that opened them.
- **strace:** Traces system calls and signals received by a process.

**3. Monitoring Resource Utilization:**

Resource monitoring tools help in understanding the resource consumption of processes, aiding in optimized system utilization and detecting bottlenecks.

- **free:** Displays information about free and used memory.
- **vmstat:** Provides an overview of system performance, including memory, CPU, and I/O statistics.
- **iostat:** Reports on disk I/O statistics.
- **netstat:** Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.

#### Process Control

Controlling processes encompasses starting, stopping, suspending, resuming, and terminating processes. It also involves managing process priorities and resource allocations.

**1. Sending Signals:**

Signals are a form of limited inter-process communication used in Unix-like systems to notify processes of various events. The `kill` command is a common tool for sending signals.

- **Common Signals:**
    - `SIGTERM` (15): Requests a process to terminate. It can be caught or ignored by the process.
    - `SIGKILL` (9): Forces a process to terminate. It cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.
    - `SIGSTOP` (19): Pauses a process execution.
    - `SIGCONT` (18): Resumes a paused process.

- **Sending Signals:**
```sh
kill -signal PID  # Example: kill -9 1234 sends SIGKILL to process 1234
```

**2. Process Priority and Scheduling:**

Linux allows the setting of process priorities to influence the scheduling of processes. The priority of a process affects the CPU time it receives.

- **nice:** Adjusts the niceness level of a process, which indirectly influences its priority. Lower niceness values increase priority, while higher values decrease it.
    - The range is from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority).
- **renice:** Changes the priority of a running process.

- **Scheduling Policies:**
    - **SCHED_OTHER:** The default Linux time-sharing scheduler.
    - **SCHED_FIFO:** First-in, first-out real-time scheduler.
    - **SCHED_RR:** Round-robin real-time scheduler.
    - **SCHED_DEADLINE:** Deadline-based scheduler for real-time tasks.

**3. Terminating Processes:**

Terminating processes can be done using various commands and signals:

- **kill:** Normal termination of a process using signals.
- **pkill:** Terminates processes matching a criteria (e.g., by name).
- **killall:** Terminates all processes matching a given name.

#### Advanced Process Control Techniques

**1. cgroups (Control Groups):**

Control Groups (cgroups) are a Linux kernel feature for grouping processes and controlling their resource usage. They provide fine-grained resource allocation control for processes.

- **Resource Limits:** Memory, CPU, I/O, and network bandwidth can be limited for a group of processes.
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Enables nested grouping of processes, with resource limits applied hierarchically.
- **Isolation:** Processes within different cgroups can be isolated from each other in terms of resources.

- **Example Usage:**
```sh
# Create a cgroup and limit CPU usage
cgcreate -g cpu:/mygroup
cgset -r cpu.shares=512 mygroup  # 50% CPU time
cgexec -g cpu:mygroup /usr/bin/my_app
```

**2. Namespaces:**

Namespaces provide isolated environments for processes, allowing multiple instances of global resources.

- **Types of Namespaces:**
    - **PID Namespace:** Isolates process ID numbers.
    - **NET Namespace:** Isolates network interfaces and routing tables.
    - **MNT Namespace:** Isolates mount points.
    - **UTS Namespace:** Isolates hostname and domain name.
    - **USER Namespace:** Isolates user and group IDs.
    - **IPC Namespace:** Isolates inter-process communication resources.

- **Example:**
    - Starting a new process in a new namespace:
```sh
unshare --pid --fork bash
```

**3. ptrace:**

`ptrace` is a system call providing the ability to observe and control the execution of another process. It is primarily used by debuggers like `gdb`.

- **Debugging:** Attaches to a process for debugging, allowing setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting memory and registers.
- **Process Interception:** Processes can be intercepted and modified at runtime, useful for security tools and sandboxing.

**4. Seccomp:**

Secure computing mode (seccomp) restricts the system calls a process can make. It enhances security by limiting the process’s capabilities.

- **Seccomp-bpf:** Uses Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF) to create sophisticated filters for system calls.
- **Example Usage:** Seccomp filters are often implemented in applications needing high security, preventing exploits by limiting available system calls.

#### Practical Application and Example

For a comprehensive understanding, consider a scenario involving process monitoring and control in a server environment:

**Scenario: Server Process Management**

Imagine managing processes for a web server application with different components for handling HTTP requests, database interactions, and background tasks.

- **Monitoring:** 
    - Use `top` or `htop` to monitor process performance and resource utilization in real-time.
    - Analyze specific processes using `ps` and `/proc/[pid]` files for detailed information.

- **Controlling:**
    - Adjust process priorities with `nice` and `renice` to ensure the web server receives adequate CPU time.
    - Use `cgroups` to limit the memory usage of background tasks, preventing them from affecting the main HTTP server processes.
    - Employ `kill`, `pkill`, and `killall` to manage runaway or unresponsive processes.

- **Advanced Techniques:**
    - Implement `namespaces` for process isolation, ensuring each component of the web server runs in its own environment, isolating fault domains.
    - Use `ptrace` and debugging tools to trace and fix issues in the server components.
    - Apply `seccomp` filters to the web server processes to restrict system calls, enhancing security by limiting their operational capability to only necessary actions.

Here is some example code demonstrating a basic monitoring and control mechanism in C++:

```cpp
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

void monitor_process(pid_t pid) {
    std::string proc_path = "/proc/" + std::to_string(pid) + "/status";
    std::ifstream proc_file(proc_path);

    if (!proc_file) {
        std::cerr << "Unable to open " << proc_path << "\n";
        return;
    }

    std::string line;
    while (std::getline(proc_file, line)) {
        std::cout << line << "\n";
    }
}

void control_process(pid_t pid, int signal) {
    if (kill(pid, signal) == 0) {
        std::cout << "Signal " << signal << " sent to process " << pid << "\n";
    } else {
        perror("Failed to send signal");
    }
}

int main() {
    pid_t pid;
    std::cout << "Enter PID to monitor: ";
    std::cin >> pid;

    std::cout << "Monitoring process " << pid << "\n";
    monitor_process(pid);

    std::cout << "Enter signal to send (e.g., 15 for SIGTERM): ";
    int signal;
    std::cin >> signal;

    std::cout << "Sending signal " << signal << " to process " << pid << "\n";
    control_process(pid, signal);

    return 0;
}
```

This code provides a basic interface for monitoring the details of a process through the `/proc` filesystem and sending signals to control it.

#### Conclusion

Monitoring and controlling processes is a cornerstone skill in Linux system administration and development. By mastering the use of `/proc`, system commands, signals, cgroups, namespaces, and advanced tools like `ptrace` and `seccomp`, you can ensure efficient, secure, and stable operation of your processes. The implementation of these techniques enables fine-grained control and optimization, critical for managing complex applications and systems in a multitasking environment.
