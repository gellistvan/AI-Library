# Part II: Kernel Architecture

## 3. Kernel Initialization 

Before a running Linux kernel can manage hardware resources, schedule processes, and handle system calls, it must go through a meticulous initialization sequence. This chapter delves into the intricate steps of the kernel initialization process, starting from the moment the power button is pressed to the point where user-space applications are launched. We will begin by providing an overview of the boot process, discussing the roles of various boot loaders and detailing their contribution to bringing the system to a state where the kernel can take control. Following this, we will explore the kernel's own initialization routines, shedding light on the systematic procedures it employs to set up basic hardware, initialize system structures, and prepare the system to be operable. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the crucial steps the Linux kernel takes during its bootstrapping phase to transform a powered-down machine into a functional environment ready to execute tasks.

### Boot Process Overview

The process of booting a computer from an off state to a fully operational state is a complex sequence that involves multiple stages, each of which plays a pivotal role in setting up the system. This section aims to provide a thorough overview of the boot process, covering everything from the initial power-on event to the execution of the Linux kernel's first instructions.

#### 1. Power-On and Reset

The boot process begins the moment power is supplied to the system. When you press the power button, a signal is sent to the power supply unit (PSU), which then distributes power to the various components of the computer, such as the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and storage devices. This initial power-on event also triggers the reset circuitry on the motherboard.

The reset signal ensures that all the components start in a known state. For the CPU, this means that its registers are initialized, its instruction pointer is set to the reset vector address, and it starts fetching instructions from a predefined memory location, typically found in the system's firmware (BIOS or UEFI).

#### 2. Firmware Execution: BIOS or UEFI

Upon receiving the reset signal, the CPU begins executing the firmware code located at the reset vector address. Modern systems predominantly use one of two firmware interfaces: BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).

##### BIOS

1. **POST (Power-On Self-Test)**: The BIOS performs a series of diagnostic tests, collectively known as the Power-On Self-Test (POST). These tests check the integrity and functionality of the system's core components such as the CPU, RAM, and keyboard. If any critical hardware failure is detected, the process may halt and signal an error through beeps or blinking LEDs.

2. **Initialization**: After successful completion of POST, the BIOS initializes system hardware. This includes configuring the memory controller, setting up hardware timers, and initializing I/O peripherals.

3. **Device Enumeration**: The BIOS scans for connected devices such as storage drives, graphics cards, and network interfaces. It assigns resources like I/O ports and IRQs to these devices.

4. **Boot Device Selection**: The BIOS then follows the boot order specified in the firmware settings to locate a bootable device. This could be a hard disk, SSD, CD-ROM, or other supported boot device.

##### UEFI

UEFI provides a more modern and flexible interface compared to BIOS and supports larger boot volumes, faster boot times, and a more scalable structure. It operates in the following manner:

1. **Secure Boot**: UEFI can validate the digital signatures of the bootloader and other critical components to ensure that they haven't been tampered with, enhancing system security.

2. **Initialization**: UEFI initializes hardware components and system services required for the boot process. It also supports a pre-boot execution environment (PEI) which allows for complex configurations and the execution of rich pre-boot applications.

3. **Device Enumeration and Initialization**: Similar to BIOS, UEFI enumerates and initializes system devices. It also maintains a Global Unified Namespace, offering a more accessible and organized view of system resources.

4. **Boot Manager**: UEFI features a built-in boot manager that can directly execute bootloaders from different filesystems. This provides flexibility in choosing the operating system or firmware application without relying on a BIOS-style boot order.

#### 3. Boot Loaders and Boot Sequence

Once the firmware has handed control to the bootloader, the bootloader's primary role is to load the Linux kernel into memory and execute it. Several bootloaders are compatible with Linux, including GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader), LILO (Linux Loader), and Syslinux/EXTLINUX, among others. Let's focus on the most commonly used bootloader, GRUB.

##### GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)

GRUB is a versatile and powerful bootloader commonly used in Linux systems. It supports multiple filesystems, network booting, and a wide range of configurations. The GRUB boot process can be divided into several stages:

1. **Stage 1**: The Stage 1 bootloader code is stored in the Master Boot Record (MBR) or the GUID Partition Table (GPT) of the boot device. Its primary job is to locate the Stage 1.5 or Stage 2 bootloader code. Given the limited size of the MBR (typically 512 bytes), Stage 1 is very minimalistic.

2. **Stage 1.5**: This optional stage exists if the filesystem is supported by GRUB but cannot be directly loaded by Stage 1. It acts as a bridge between Stage 1 and Stage 2, facilitating access to complex filesystems.

3. **Stage 2**: Stage 2 is the main part of GRUB. It presents a user interface that allows for the selection of the kernel or operating system to boot. Stage 2 is responsible for loading the kernel image and the initial ramdisk (initrd or initramfs) into memory.

4. **Kernel Loading**: GRUB loads the selected kernel and passes control to it. Along with the kernel, GRUB may also load an initial ramdisk (initrd or initramfs) which contains essential drivers and initialization scripts needed to mount the real root filesystem.

Here is a simplified example of what a GRUB configuration file (`grub.cfg`) might look like:

```bash
menuentry 'Linux' {
   set root='hd0,msdos1'
   linux /boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-42-generic root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet splash
   initrd /boot/initrd.img-5.4.0-42-generic
}
```

#### 4. Kernel Initialization

Once the bootloader transfers control to the kernel, the kernel initialization sequence begins. This is a highly complex process that can be divided into several key stages:

##### Early Kernel Initialization

1. **Kernel Decompression**: If the kernel image is compressed, it will first decompress itself into memory. Most modern Linux kernels are compressed to save space and reduce load times.

2. **Start Kernel**: The kernel begins executing its `start_kernel` function. This function sets up basic hardware interfaces and prepares the kernel environment.

3. **Basic Hardware Setup**: At this stage, the kernel configures essential CPU settings, such as setting page tables for virtual memory management and initializing hardware interrupt handling.

4. **Device Enumeration and Initialization**: The kernel starts initializing essential devices and subsystems. This includes setting up memory management structures, initializing the scheduler, and initializing device drivers for essential hardware components.

##### Init Process

1. **Root Filesystem Mounting**: The kernel mounts the root filesystem specified by the bootloader. Initially, this may involve mounting an initial ramdisk (initrd or initramfs) to set up the environment required for mounting the actual root filesystem.

2. **Execution of Init**: The kernel then executes the first user-space program, typically `/sbin/init`. This program is responsible for initializing user-space components and setting up the working environment for all other processes.

##### Systemd as Init

In modern Linux distributions, `systemd` has replaced the traditional `init` as the first process. It provides a comprehensive and unified framework for initializing user-space components and managing system services.

Here is a simplified view of the `systemd` boot sequence:

1. **Basic System Initialization**: `systemd` initializes basic system components and units, such as configuring the hostname, setting up loopback network interfaces, and loading kernel modules specified by configuration files.

2. **Service Initialization**: `systemd` then starts various system services based on dependency configurations. These may include starting a logging daemon, configuring network interfaces, and launching graphical or command-line user interfaces.

3. **Target Reached**: Finally, `systemd` reaches a target state, such as `multi-user.target` for multi-user command line mode or `graphical.target` for graphical user interface mode. At this point, the system is fully initialized and ready for user interaction.

#### Conclusion

The process of booting a Linux system is an intricate choreography involving multiple components, each playing a critical role. From the moment power is applied, through the firmware initialization, bootloader execution, and finally kernel initialization, every step is meticulously designed to prepare the system for operation. Understanding this sequence is crucial for anyone interested in Linux kernel internals, as it forms the foundation upon which all other kernel functionalities are built. By comprehending the boot process, one gains insight into the kernel's architecture, enabling more effective debugging, development, and optimization efforts.


### Boot Loaders and Boot Sequence

In the context of computer systems, bootloaders play the critical role of loading an operating system's kernel into memory and transferring control from the firmware to the operating system. This transition phase is crucial because it bridges the gap between the low-level firmware (BIOS or UEFI) and the high-level operating system. Bootloaders come in various forms, each with unique features and mechanisms. This chapter thoroughly examines the architecture, functionality, and flexibility of major bootloaders including GRUB, LILO, and Syslinux/EXTLINUX, along with a detailed analysis of their respective boot sequences.

#### 1. GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)

GRUB, short for the GRand Unified Bootloader, is perhaps the most widely used bootloader in Linux environments. Designed to support various operating systems and filesystems, GRUB is known for its flexibility and robust feature set.

##### Architecture of GRUB

GRUB's architecture is divided into multiple stages: Stage 1, Stage 1.5, and Stage 2.

- **Stage 1**: This initial stage is stored in the MBR or the boot sector of a storage device. Because the MBR is limited to 512 bytes, Stage 1 is minimalistic, containing just enough code to locate and load Stage 1.5 or Stage 2. It is responsible for locating the next stage in the boot process.
  
- **Stage 1.5**: This interim stage is sometimes used if the filesystem from which Stage 2 will be loaded is complex. Stage 1.5 can interpret filesystems like ext4, XFS, or Btrfs. This stage is generally stored in the space immediately following the MBR or in a separate partition.

- **Stage 2**: This is the main stage of GRUB. Stage 2 is responsible for presenting the user interface for selecting and booting an OS. It reads the configuration file, typically found at `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, and loads the kernel and initial ramdisk (initrd or initramfs) into memory.

##### GRUB Configuration

The GRUB configuration file (`grub.cfg`) is central to its operation. It defines which kernels or operating systems are available for booting and any associated parameters. Here’s an example of a typical `grub.cfg`:

```bash
menuentry 'Ubuntu' {
   set root='hd0,msdos1'
   linux /boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-42-generic root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet splash
   initrd /boot/initrd.img-5.4.0-42-generic
}

menuentry 'Windows' {
   set root='hd0,msdos2'
   chainloader +1
}
```

- **`menuentry`**: Defines each bootable option.
- **`set root`**: Sets the root device where the kernel resides.
- **`linux`**: Points to the kernel image and passes kernel parameters.
- **`initrd`**: Specifies the initial ramdisk.
- **`chainloader`**: Used to boot another bootloader, common for dual-booting with Windows.

##### Boot Sequence of GRUB

1. **Firmware Initialization**: The system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) initializes and hands control to the Stage 1 of the bootloader, typically located at the MBR.
  
2. **Stage 1 Execution**: GRUB Stage 1 loads and executes Stage 1.5 or Stage 2.

3. **Stage 1.5 (if used)**: It loads necessary filesystem drivers to find and load Stage 2.

4. **Stage 2 Execution**: The primary user interface is loaded, allowing the user to select an OS or kernel to boot.

5. **Kernel Loading**: GRUB Stage 2 loads the selected kernel and initial ramdisk into memory, passing control to the kernel start code.

#### 2. LILO (Linux Loader)

LILO is another well-known bootloader, although it has largely fallen out of favor compared to GRUB. It is simpler but less flexible.

##### Architecture of LILO

LILO is composed of:
- **MBR/Superblock Code**: Loads the primary boot loader.
- **Secondary Boot Loader**: Handles the bulk of the booting process, loading the kernel.

Unlike GRUB, LILO lacks a terminal-based command interface for editing boot parameters at boot time. Once installed, its configuration must be set in advance and written into the boot sectors.

##### LILO Configuration

LILO's configuration file is typically `/etc/lilo.conf`. Here’s a simple example:

```bash
boot=/dev/sda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
default=linux

image=/boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-42-generic
   label=linux
   read-only
   root=/dev/sda1

other=/dev/sda2
   label=windows
   table=/dev/sda
```
- **`boot`**: Specifies the device to install the bootloader.
- **`default`**: Indicates the default boot selection.
- **`image`**: Specifies the Linux kernel image.
- **`other`**: Used for non-Linux OS boot entries.

##### Boot Sequence of LILO

1. **Firmware Initialization**: The system firmware locates the LILO primary boot loader from the MBR or partition boot sector.
  
2. **Primary Boot Loader Execution**: This loader locates and loads the secondary bootloader.
  
3. **Secondary Boot Loader Execution**: Reads the configuration and loads the specified kernel or operating system into memory.
  
4. **Kernel Loading**: Transfers control to the kernel, initiating the operating system boot sequence.

#### 3. Syslinux/EXTLINUX

Syslinux and EXTLINUX are another pair of versatile bootloaders, predominantly used for lightweight or specialized environments like live USBs or embedded systems.

##### Architecture of Syslinux/EXTLINUX

Syslinux and EXTLINUX have similar architecture:
- **Primary Stage**: Resides in the MBR or boot sector.
- **Configurable Interface**: Uses configuration files to specify the kernel and parameters.

##### Syslinux Configuration

Syslinux uses a straightforward configuration file usually named `syslinux.cfg`. Here’s an example:

```bash
DEFAULT linux
LABEL linux
   KERNEL /boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-42-generic
   APPEND root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet splash
```
- **`DEFAULT`**: Sets the default boot entry.
- **`LABEL`**: Defines each bootable image.
- **`KERNEL`**: Specifies the path to the kernel.
- **`APPEND`**: Adds kernel command-line parameters.

##### Boot Sequence of Syslinux

1. **Firmware Initialization**: Boots the primary Syslinux stage from the MBR or boot sector.
  
2. **Primary Stage Execution**: Loads the Syslinux interface and reads the configuration file.
  
3. **Kernel Loading**: Loads the specified kernel and initial ramdisk, if any.
  
4. **Execution**: Transfers control to the kernel.

#### 4. Boot Sequence Analysis

Understanding the boot sequences of these bootloaders provides key insights into their operations.

##### GRUB

- **Versatility**: Supports numerous filesystems, complex configurations, and multiple operating systems.
- **Flexibility**: Modular structure allows adding functionalities like password protection, themes, and network booting.

##### LILO

- **Simplicity**: Direct and straightforward, suitable for simpler systems.
- **Lack of Flexibility**: No runtime intervention means any change requires reinstallation of LILO.
  
##### Syslinux/EXTLINUX

- **Lightweight**: Ideal for embedded systems, live environments.
- **Simplicity**: Easier for users to configure compared to GRUB.

#### 5. Conclusion

The bootloader's role in the system initialization process is indispensable. It acts as the intermediary between the system firmware and the operating system, ensuring the correct loading and execution of the kernel. Each bootloader has its specific architecture, strengths, and constraints. GRUB offers versatility and complex configuration, LILO provides a simple, albeit outdated, solution, while Syslinux/EXTLINUX suits specialized, lightweight environments. Understanding these bootloaders in depth not only allows system administrators and developers to make informed choices but also provides a foundation for advanced customization and troubleshooting in Linux environments. Through rigorous understanding of bootloaders and their sequences, one gains critical insights essential for mastering Linux kernel internals.

### Kernel Initialization Process

The kernel initialization process is a crucial phase that transforms the system from a booted kernel image to a functional operating environment capable of running user-space applications. This transformation involves a meticulously orchestrated sequence of events and operations that initialize critical subsystems, detect and configure hardware, and prepare the operating environment. This chapter delves deeply into the inner workings of the Linux kernel's initialization process, providing a comprehensive examination of each step, from the earliest moments after the kernel image is loaded into memory to the fully operational system state.

#### 1. Early Kernel Initialization

The early stages of kernel initialization are focused on setting up the most fundamental aspects of the kernel's execution environment. The following are the principal tasks performed during early kernel initialization:

##### 1.1 Kernel Decompression

Most modern Linux kernels are compressed to save storage space and reduce load times. When the bootloader loads the kernel into memory, it usually loads a compressed kernel image. The first task of the kernel is to decompress itself. This process is handled by a small decompression stub embedded in the kernel image. The decompression code expands the kernel into its full size in memory.

##### 1.2 Setup Code

Once decompressed, the kernel begins executing its setup code. This code is responsible for basic processor initialization and setting up the initial environment needed for the kernel to operate. Key tasks include:

1. Setting up the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT).
2. Switching the CPU from real mode to protected mode (for x86 architectures).
3. Initializing low-level hardware, such as the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT).
4. Establishing an initial stack for the kernel to use during setup.

The setup code also performs basic memory detection, identifying the available physical memory and gathering essential system information from the firmware.

##### 1.3 Transition to C Code

After the initial assembly setup, control is transferred to the kernel's C code. This transition allows the kernel to leverage the full power of the C programming language for more complex initialization tasks.

#### 2. The `start_kernel` Function

The `start_kernel` function is the central function in the kernel's initialization sequence. It is defined in the `init/main.c` file and orchestrates many critical initialization tasks. The outline of the `start_kernel` function may look complex, but it is designed to methodically initialize various kernel components.

Here is a very high-level pseudo-code outline of `start_kernel`:

```c
void __init start_kernel(void) {
   setup_arch(&command_line);
   setup_vector();
   init_IRQ();
   tick_init();
   rcu_init();
   sched_init();
   idr_init_cache();
   ...
   rest_init();
}
```

Below are the major components and functions called by `start_kernel`:

##### 2.1 `setup_arch`

The `setup_arch` function is architecture-specific and performs initial setup tasks for the given CPU architecture. Typical tasks include:

- Initializing architecture-specific memory management.
- Detecting and configuring hardware resources like CPUs and memory.
- Setting up platform-specific data structures.

##### 2.2 `init_IRQ`

This function initializes the kernel's interrupt handling mechanisms. Interrupts are central to the kernel's ability to respond to hardware events, and proper initialization is crucial. The tasks include:

- Setting up interrupt vectors.
- Initializing interrupt controllers (e.g., APIC for x86 architectures).
- Registering default interrupt handlers.

##### 2.3 `tick_init`

The `tick_init` function initializes the kernel's timer subsystem. Timers are critical for task scheduling, timekeeping, and various time-related functions within the kernel. The timer setup involves:

- Initializing high-resolution timers.
- Configuring the timing hardware.
- Setting up periodic timer interrupts for the scheduler.

##### 2.4 `rcu_init`

The Read-Copy-Update (RCU) subsystem is an essential synchronization mechanism used extensively within the kernel. `rcu_init` initializes the RCU infrastructure, enabling efficient and scalable concurrent access to shared data structures.

##### 2.5 `sched_init`

The `sched_init` function sets up the kernel's process scheduler. This involves:

- Initializing scheduler data structures.
- Configuring CPU run queues.
- Setting up initial scheduling policies.

#### 3. Memory Management Initialization

Memory management is one of the most critical aspects of the kernel initialization process. The Linux kernel employs a sophisticated and flexible memory management system capable of handling diverse workloads and hardware configurations.

##### 3.1 Paging and Virtual Memory

As part of the architecture-specific setup, the kernel initializes paging and virtual memory. This includes setting up the initial page tables and enabling the Memory Management Unit (MMU). Paging enables the kernel to manage memory in a flexible and isolated manner by providing each process with its virtual address space.

##### 3.2 Physical Memory Management

The kernel detects physical memory and initializes structures to manage it. This includes setting up the memory map, which indicates which portions of physical memory are available, reserved, or in use. Functions like `memblock_init` and `bootmem_init` are involved in this process.

##### 3.3 Kernel Memory Allocator

The kernel memory allocator is initialized early in the boot process. This is crucial for dynamically allocating memory to subsystems and drivers as they initialize. The primary kernel memory allocator, the SLAB allocator (or SLUB, SLOB depending on configuration), is initialized to manage memory allocation and deallocation efficiently.

#### 4. Device Subsystem Initialization

The device initialization phase sets up the hardware abstraction layer, making it possible for the kernel to interact with physical devices uniformly.

##### 4.1 Driver Initialization

The kernel initializes built-in drivers and probes for devices. This involves:

- Detecting hardware devices present in the system.
- Loading and initializing appropriate drivers.
- Registering devices with the kernel's device model.

##### 4.2 Bus Initialization

Bus subsystems, such as PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) and USB, are initialized during this phase. This involves:

- Scanning buses for connected devices.
- Enumerating and configuring devices.
- Registering devices with the system.

##### 4.3 Filesystem Initialization

The kernel initializes its internal filesystem structures and mounts the initial filesystem (initramfs or initrd). This temporary filesystem contains essential drivers and initialization scripts needed to complete the boot process.

#### 5. Root Filesystem Mount

The initializing of the root filesystem is an essential step in the boot process. This typically occurs through the following steps:

1. **Initial RAM Disk (initrd/initramfs)**: The bootloader loads an initial ramdisk into memory, containing kernel modules and initial system programs necessary to mount the real root filesystem.
2. **Mount Real Root Filesystem**: The initramfs executes scripts that ultimately mount the real root filesystem from the specified device (`root=/dev/sda1` or similar).

#### 6. `init` and `systemd`

After mounting the root filesystem, the kernel starts the first user-space program. Traditionally, this was `/sbin/init`, but in modern Linux systems, `systemd` is often used.

##### 6.1 `init`

Historically, the `init` process is the first user-space process, responsible for starting essential services and system initialization.

##### 6.2 `systemd`

In contemporary Linux distributions, `systemd` has largely replaced `init` as the system and service manager. `systemd` provides a comprehensive framework for managing system initialization, services, and dependencies.

Here is an overview of the `systemd` startup sequence:

- **Basic System Initialization**: Starting essential services, such as udev (device manager) and D-Bus (inter-process communication).
- **Service Dependency Handling**: Ensuring that services are started in the correct order based on their dependencies.
- **Interactive Targets**: Reaching user interaction targets like multi-user or graphical interfaces.

#### 7. User-Space Transition

Once the init process (or systemd) starts, the system transitions from kernel space to user space. This means the operating environment is now ready to run user applications, services, and perform its intended functions. Key activities include:

- **Service Initialization**: Starting network services, daemons, and user applications.
- **Login Prompts**: Displaying login prompts on virtual terminals or graphical login screens.

#### 8. Conclusion

The kernel initialization process is a highly structured and intricate sequence of operations that lay the foundation for a fully functional Linux operating system. From the first moments after the kernel is loaded into memory by the bootloader, through the complex setup of memory management, hardware initialization, and subsystem configuration, each step is meticulously designed to ensure a stable and efficient operating environment. By understanding the details of this process, one gains profound insights into the Linux kernel's architecture and operational principles, enabling more effective troubleshooting, customization, and optimization. This foundational knowledge is crucial for anyone seeking to master Linux kernel internals and develop expertise in Linux-based systems.
