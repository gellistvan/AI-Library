## Appendix C: Example Code and Exercises 

Diving deep into the intricacies of the Linux kernel can be both intellectually stimulating and practically challenging. To aid in the comprehension and application of the concepts discussed throughout this book, Appendix C presents a collection of example programs and exercises. This appendix serves as a bridge between theoretical understanding and hands-on practice, offering you tangible code snippets that illustrate key kernel mechanisms and providing exercises designed to reinforce your learning. Whether you're a budding kernel developer or an experienced programmer seeking to refine your skills, this section is crafted to enhance your grasp of Linux kernel internals through active engagement and experimentation.

### Sample Programs Demonstrating Key Concepts

In this subchapter, we delve into specific example programs to elucidate the key concepts of the Linux kernel. By examining these examples, you'll gain a more comprehensive understanding of the kernel's inner workings. We'll cover various core areas, from process management and inter-process communication to memory management and device interactions. Each example program will be analyzed line by line to illuminate the functionality and its relevance to the overarching principles discussed in the preceding chapters.

#### Process Management

**Process Creation and Termination**

One of the fundamental aspects of the Linux kernel is process management. Process creation and termination are central to any operating system, and the fork-exec model is pivotal in Linux.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
   pid_t pid = fork();

   if (pid < 0) {
      perror("Fork failed");
      return 1;
   } else if (pid == 0) {
      printf("Child process: PID = %d\n", getpid());
      execlp("/bin/ls", "ls", NULL);
      perror("execlp failed");
      return 1;
   } else {
      printf("Parent process: PID = %d\n", getpid());
      wait(NULL);
      printf("Child process finished.\n");
   }
   return 0;
}
```

**Analysis:**

- `fork()`: Creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. Returns 0 in the child process, and the child's PID in the parent process.
- `execlp()`: Replaces the current process image with a new process image specified by the file path and arguments.
- `wait()`: Halts the parent process until the child process finishes execution.

This simple program demonstrates how a parent process can create a child process, execute a different program within the child, and ensure the parent waits for the child to complete.

**Kernel Viewpoint:**

Whenever `fork()` is called, the kernel leverages the `copy-on-write` (COW) mechanism to optimize memory use. Instead of making a full copy of the process's address space, it lets both processes (parent and child) share the same pages until a write occurs. On the first write, the kernel makes a copy of the page for the writing process.

#### Inter-process Communication (IPC)

**Pipes**

Pipes are among the simplest IPC mechanisms in Unix-like systems, facilitating unidirectional data flow between processes.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
   int fd[2];
   pid_t pid;
   char buffer[1024];

   if (pipe(fd) == -1) {
      perror("pipe failed");
      return 1;
   }

   pid = fork();

   if (pid < 0) {
      perror("fork failed");
      return 1;
   } else if (pid == 0) {
      close(fd[0]);
      write(fd[1], "Hello from child", 16);
      close(fd[1]);
   } else {
      close(fd[1]);
      read(fd[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
      printf("Parent received: %s\n", buffer);
      close(fd[0]);
   }

   return 0;
}
```

**Analysis:**

- `pipe(fd)`: Creates a pipe with two file descriptors: `fd[0]` for reading and `fd[1]` for writing.
- `write(fd[1], ...)` and `read(fd[0], ...)`: Allow data flow from the child process to the parent process.

**Kernel Viewpoint:**

The kernel maintains a circular buffer for the pipe's data. When `write()` is called, data is copied into this buffer. Conversely, `read()` extracts data from it. Proper synchronization mechanisms ensure that reads and writes occur safely.

#### Memory Management

**Shared Memory**

Shared memory segments can be used to allow multiple processes to access the same memory space.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
   key_t key = 1234;
   int shmid;
   char *shared_memory;
   
    // Create a shared memory segment
   shmid = shmget(key, 1024, 0666|IPC_CREAT);
   if (shmid == -1) {
      perror("shmget failed");
      return 1;
   }

   // Attach to the shared memory
   shared_memory = (char*) shmat(shmid, NULL, 0);
   if (shared_memory == (char*) -1) {
      perror("shmat failed");
      return 1;
   }

   // Write data to shared memory
   strncpy(shared_memory, "Hello, Shared Memory!", 1024);

   // Detach from shared memory
   if (shmdt(shared_memory) == -1) {
      perror("shmdt failed");
      return 1;
   }

   printf("Data written to shared memory: %s\n", shared_memory);

   return 0;
}
```

**Analysis:**

- `shmget()`: Allocates a shared memory segment identified by a key.
- `shmat()`: Attaches the allocated shared memory segment to the process's address space for access.
- `shmdt()`: Detaches the shared memory segment from the process's address space once operations are complete.

**Kernel Viewpoint:**

The kernel manages shared memory segments by maintaining a set of structures that track the usage and permissions of each segment. These structures ensure synchronization and mutual exclusion when multiple processes attempt to access the shared memory.

#### Device Interaction

**Character Device Driver**

Character device drivers handle device input/output as a stream of bytes.

```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
#include <linux/cdev.h>
#include <linux/uaccess.h>

#define DEVICE_NAME "example_char_dev"
#define BUF_LEN 80

static int device_open = 0;
static char msg[BUF_LEN];
static struct cdev my_cdev;
static dev_t dev_num;
static int major_number;

static int dev_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file) {
   if (device_open) return -EBUSY;
   device_open++;
   try_module_get(THIS_MODULE);
   return 0;
}

static int dev_release(struct inode *inode, struct file *file) {
   device_open--;
   module_put(THIS_MODULE);
   return 0;
}

static ssize_t dev_read(struct file *filp, char *buffer, size_t length, loff_t *offset) {
   int bytes_read = 0;
   if (*msg == 0) return 0;
   while (length && *msg) {
      put_user(*(msg++), buffer++);
      length--;
      bytes_read++;
   }
   return bytes_read;
}

static ssize_t dev_write(struct file *filp, const char *buffer, size_t length, loff_t *offset) {
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i < length && i < BUF_LEN; i++) {
      get_user(msg[i], buffer + i);
   }
   msg[i] = '\0';
   return i;
}

static struct file_operations fops = {
   .read = dev_read,
   .write = dev_write,
   .open = dev_open,
   .release = dev_release
};

static int __init char_dev_init(void) {
   int result = alloc_chrdev_region(&dev_num, 0, 1, DEVICE_NAME);
   if (result < 0) return result;
   major_number = MAJOR(dev_num);
   cdev_init(&my_cdev, &fops);
   my_cdev.owner = THIS_MODULE;
   result = cdev_add(&my_cdev, dev_num, 1);
   if (result < 0) {
      unregister_chrdev_region(dev_num, 1);
      return result;
   }
   printk(KERN_INFO "Loaded char device %s with major number %d\n", DEVICE_NAME, major_number);
   return 0;
}

static void __exit char_dev_exit(void) {
   cdev_del(&my_cdev);
   unregister_chrdev_region(dev_num, 1);
   printk(KERN_INFO "Unloaded char device %s with major number %d\n", DEVICE_NAME, major_number);
}

module_init(char_dev_init);
module_exit(char_dev_exit);

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Example Character Device Driver");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Author Name");
```

**Analysis:**

- `cdev_add()`: Registers the character device with the kernel.
- `dev_open()`, `dev_read()`, `dev_write()`, `dev_release()`: Define the system calls for interacting with the device.

**Kernel Viewpoint:**

Character device drivers interface with user space through file operations. The kernel dispatches calls to the corresponding system calls defined in `struct file_operations`.

#### Network Packet Transmission

**Netfilter Example**

Netfilter provides framework for packet handling in the Linux kernel.

```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/netfilter.h>
#include <linux/netfilter_ipv4.h>
#include <linux/ip.h>

static struct nf_hook_ops nfho;

unsigned int hook_func(void *priv, struct sk_buff *skb, const struct nf_hook_state *state) {
   struct iphdr *ip_header = (struct iphdr *)skb_network_header(skb);

   if(ip_header->protocol == IPPROTO_ICMP) {
      printk(KERN_INFO "Dropped ICMP packet from %pI4\n", &ip_header->saddr);
      return NF_DROP;
   }

   return NF_ACCEPT;
}

static int __init init_module(void) {
   nfho.hook = hook_func;
   nfho.hooknum = NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING;
   nfho.pf = PF_INET;
   nfho.priority = NF_IP_PRI_FIRST;

   nf_register_hook(&nfho);
   printk(KERN_INFO "Netfilter module loaded\n");
   
    return 0;
}

static void __exit cleanup_module(void) {
   nf_unregister_hook(&nfho);
   printk(KERN_INFO "Netfilter module unloaded\n");
}

module_init(init_module);
module_exit(cleanup_module);

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Example Netfilter Module");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Author Name");
```

**Analysis:**

- `nf_register_hook()`: Registers a function to be called for packet handling.
- `NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING`: Specifies the hook point for incoming packets.
- `hook_func()`: The user-defined function for packet inspection and decision-making.

**Kernel Viewpoint:**

Netfilter hooks facilitate the monitoring and manipulation of packet flows. They enable the kernel to efficiently implement firewall rules, NAT, and other packet processing tasks.
