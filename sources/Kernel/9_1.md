# Part IX: Security

## 28. Kernel Security Mechanisms

In the dynamic and interconnected landscape of modern computing, the imperative to safeguard systems and data from malicious threats has led to the development of sophisticated security mechanisms within the Linux kernel. Chapter 28 delves into the core frameworks and technologies that form the bedrock of Linux kernel security. This chapter will explore the critical role of Linux Security Modules (LSM), which provide a flexible architecture for enforcing access control policies. We will examine SELinux and AppArmor, two prominent LSM implementations that offer robust security policies tailored to diverse use cases. Additionally, we’ll delve into Secure Computing (seccomp), a mechanism that restricts the system calls a process can make to prevent unintended or malicious actions. Together, these kernel security mechanisms fortify the integrity and confidentiality of Linux systems, ensuring they can withstand the evolving landscape of cyber threats.

### Security Modules (LSM)

#### Introduction

The Linux Security Modules (LSM) framework is an integral part of the Linux kernel’s architecture, designed to enhance security by allowing various access control mechanisms to be integrated seamlessly. The primary goal of LSM is to enable the enforcement of mandatory access control policies that regulate how subjects (processes) interact with objects (files, sockets, etc.) in the system. LSM provides an infrastructure for integrating security models directly into the kernel, offering flexibility and extensibility while maintaining backward compatibility with existing Linux security paradigms.

#### Historical Context

The introduction of LSM was driven by the need for a flexible and standardized method to implement security policies within the Linux kernel. Before LSM, security features were often added in an ad-hoc manner, leading to fragmentation and inconsistencies. The LSM framework was merged into the Linux kernel in version 2.6. This adoption was a significant step forward in system security, enabling the development of various security modules such as SELinux, AppArmor, Smack, and TOMOYO.

#### Architecture and Design

The LSM framework is designed to be minimally intrusive, adding hooks at key points in the kernel where security decisions are made. These hooks are strategically placed in code paths that handle system calls, file system operations, inter-process communication, and network interactions. When a security-relevant event occurs, the corresponding LSM hook invokes registered security modules that can then grant or deny access based on their policies.

##### Key Components

1. **LSM Hooks**: 
   The core of the LSM framework is a collection of hooks embedded within the kernel code. These hooks are function pointers that call security modules to make decisions on various security-sensitive operations. Examples include file creation, memory mapping, and IPC mechanisms.

2. **Security Modules**: 
   Security Modules implement specific security policies. Each module can register with the LSM framework and make use of the hooks to enforce rules on different operations. Commonly used modules include SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux), AppArmor, Smack (Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel), and TOMOYO Linux.

3. **Security Blobs**: 
   To maintain state and manage security contexts, LSM uses "security blobs." These are data structures attached to kernel objects, such as inodes, task structures, and network packets. Blobs store metadata that security modules can read and modify to enforce policies.

#### Hook Placement and Invocation

The hooks in LSM are strategically placed in areas of the kernel where security decisions are necessary. These include:

1. **File System Hooks**: 
   These hooks are placed in Virtual File System (VFS) operations, such as `open`, `read`, `write`, `chmod`, and `unlink`. They ensure that security checks occur whenever files or directories are accessed.

   ```c
   static struct security_hook_list myfs_hooks[] __lsm_ro_after_init = {
       LSM_HOOK_INIT(inode_permission, myfs_inode_permission),
       LSM_HOOK_INIT(file_open, myfs_file_open),
   };
   ```

2. **Process Management Hooks**: 
   Hooks in this domain handle operations like process creation (`fork`), termination (`exit`), and signal handling. 

   ```c
   static struct security_hook_list myproc_hooks[] __lsm_ro_after_init = {
       LSM_HOOK_INIT(task_alloc, myproc_task_alloc),
       LSM_HOOK_INIT(task_free, myproc_task_free),
   };
   ```

3. **Network Hooks**: 
   These hooks oversee networking operations, including socket creation, binding, and transmission.

   ```c
   static struct security_hook_list mynet_hooks[] __lsm_ro_after_init = {
       LSM_HOOK_INIT(socket_create, mynet_socket_create),
       LSM_HOOK_INIT(socket_sendmsg, mynet_socket_sendmsg),
   };
   ```

4. **IPC Hooks**: 
   Hooks here manage inter-process communication mechanisms like message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.

   ```c
   static struct security_hook_list myipc_hooks[] __lsm_ro_after_init = {
       LSM_HOOK_INIT(msg_queue_alloc, myipc_msg_queue_alloc),
       LSM_HOOK_INIT(shm_alloc, myipc_shm_alloc),
   };
   ```

When an operation is performed, the corresponding LSM hook is invoked, which in turn calls the specific function implemented by the active security module. For example, when a file is opened, the `file_open` hook is triggered, allowing the security module to apply its policy.

#### Registering and Implementing an LSM

Implementing a security module involves defining the security operations and registering them with the LSM framework. 

1. **Define Security Operations**: 
   A security module must define a set of operations that correspond to the LSM hooks. This involves creating functions that implement the required security checks.

   ```c
   static int myfs_inode_permission(struct inode *inode, int mask)
   {
       // Implement custom security checks here
       return 0; // Return 0 for success, -EPERM for failure
   }
   ```

2. **Register the Module**:
   The module must register its hooks with the LSM framework during initialization.

   ```c
   static struct security_operations my_security_ops = {
       .inode_permission = myfs_inode_permission,
       .task_alloc = myproc_task_alloc,
       .socket_create = mynet_socket_create,
       // More hooks as needed
   };

   static int __init my_lsm_init(void)
   {
       security_add_hooks(my_hooks, ARRAY_SIZE(my_hooks), "my_lsm");
       return 0;
   }

   security_initcall(my_lsm_init);
   ```

#### SELinux - A Comprehensive Case Study

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is one of the most widely adopted security modules built on the LSM framework. It implements mandatory access control (MAC) using a set of policies that define how processes can interact with each other and with various system resources.

##### Core Concepts

1. **Security Contexts**: 
   SELinux assigns a security context to all objects (files, processes, etc.) in the system. A context is a label that includes information such as user, role, type, and level.

2. **Policies**: 
   Policies are rules that define what actions are permitted or denied based on the security contexts of subjects and objects. Policies are compiled into binary format and loaded into the kernel.

3. **Type Enforcement (TE)**: 
   Type enforcement is a fundamental component of SELinux policies. It defines interactions using types assigned to objects and domains assigned to processes.

4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   RBAC further refines access control by assigning permissions based on user roles. It helps in limiting access based on organizational roles instead of individual users.

##### Implementation

1. **Policy Compilation and Loading**:
   Policies are written in a high-level language and then compiled into a binary format using tools like `checkpolicy`.

   ```bash
   checkpolicy -o policy.30 -c 30 mypolicy.te
   semodule -i policy.30
   ```

2. **Enforcing Policies**:
   When an action is performed, the SELinux module checks the policy rules to determine whether the action is allowed. This involves querying the security contexts of the subject and object and applying the relevant TE and RBAC rules.

   ```c
   static int selinux_inode_permission(struct inode *inode, int mask)
   {
       struct task_struct *task = current;
       struct selinux_state *state;
       struct avc_audit_data ad = AVC_AUDIT_DATA_INIT;
       
       ad.pid = task_pid_nr(task);
       ad.tclass = inode->i_security->class;
       ad.requested = mask;
       
       return avc_has_perm(&state->avc, task->security, inode->i_security, mask, &ad);
   }
   ```

#### Conclusion

The Linux Security Modules framework presents a robust and flexible infrastructure for integrating various security paradigms into the Linux kernel. By providing a standardized method for security modules to enforce access control policies, LSM enhances the overall security posture of Linux systems. Modules like SELinux and AppArmor are prime examples of the effectiveness and versatility of the LSM framework. As security threats continue to evolve, the adaptability and extensibility provided by LSM will remain crucial in maintaining the integrity and security of Linux environments.

### SELinux and AppArmor

#### Introduction

SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) and AppArmor (Application Armor) are two prominent implementations of the Linux Security Modules (LSM) framework. Both provide mandatory access control (MAC) to enforce robust security policies, but they differ significantly in their design, configuration, and policy management. This chapter provides an in-depth examination of both SELinux and AppArmor, outlining their architectural principles, security models, and practical applications. By understanding the nuances of these two powerful security tools, administrators and developers can make informed decisions about which system best meets their security requirements.

#### SELinux: Security-Enhanced Linux

##### Overview

SELinux is a comprehensive MAC system developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and was integrated into the mainline Linux kernel in 2003. It introduces a detailed and flexible security policy language that allows administrators to define and enforce security policies based on user roles, process types, and access levels.

##### Core Concepts

1. **Security Contexts**: 
   Every object (e.g., file, process) in an SELinux-enabled system has a security context, which is composed of three or four components: user, role, type, and, optionally, level.

   - **User**: SELinux user identity associated with a Linux user.
   - **Role**: Defines a set of permissions.
   - **Type**: Specifies allowed interactions between processes and objects.
   - **Level**: (Optional) Sensitivity or classification level used in MLS (Multi-Level Security) configurations.

   ```bash
   user_u:role_r:type_t:s0
   ```

2. **Type Enforcement (TE)**: 
   Type Enforcement is the cornerstone of SELinux policy. It associates types with processes and objects, controlling which types of processes can operate on which types of objects.

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   RBAC complements TE by restricting access based on roles rather than individual users. It reduces complexity by grouping permissions by role.

4. **Multi-Level Security (MLS)**: 
   MLS adds additional layers of security by integrating sensitivity levels, ensuring that only authorized users can access information at specific levels.

##### Policy Language

SELinux uses a high-level policy language to define rules. Policies are written as plain text, compiled into binary, and then loaded into the kernel.

- **Policy Modules**: Policies are divided into modules, which can be independently developed and managed.

  ```c
  policy_module(my_custom_policy, 1.0.0)
  ```

- **Type Declarations**: Define the types used in the system.

  ```c
  type my_type_t, file_type;
  ```

- **Type Transitions**: Define how types change in response to specific actions.

  ```c
  type_transition my_domain_t my_exec_t : process my_type_t;
  ```

- **Access Controls**: Grant permissions to domains for accessing types.

  ```c
  allow my_domain_t my_type_t : file { read write execute };
  ```

##### Using SELinux

1. **Installation and Setup**:
   On most Linux distributions, SELinux is available and can be installed via the package manager.

   ```bash
   sudo yum install selinux-policy-targeted
   sudo yum install policycoreutils
   ```

2. **Configuring SELinux**:
   The primary configuration file is `/etc/selinux/config`. You can set SELinux to enforcing, permissive, or disabled mode.

   ```bash
   SELINUX=enforcing
   ```

3. **Managing Policies**:
   Policies can be managed using various tools such as `semodule` for installing modules, `setsebool` for managing Boolean values, and `semanage` for customizing policies.

   ```bash
   semodule -i my_policy.pp
   setsebool my_boolean 1
   semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/web(/.*)?"
   restorecon -R /web
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   SELinux logs all access denials to audit logs, typically located at `/var/log/audit/audit.log`. Tools like `audit2allow` can be used to parse logs and generate policies to permit actions.

   ```bash
   audit2allow -w -a
   ```

#### AppArmor: Application Armor

##### Overview

AppArmor is another MAC system designed to offer a different approach to security, emphasizing ease of use and simplicity. Developed by Immunix and later acquired by Novell and Canonical, AppArmor is included in major distributions like Ubuntu and SUSE Linux. Unlike SELinux, which uses a complex policy language, AppArmor applies security profiles to applications to restrict their capabilities.

##### Core Concepts

1. **Profiles**: 
   AppArmor secures applications by confining them using profiles, which detail the permissible actions and resources for an application. Profiles can be either enforcing or complain mode.
   
   - **Enforcing Mode**: The profile strictly enforces permissions.
   - **Complain Mode**: Violations are logged but not enforced.

2. **Path-Based Access Control**:
   AppArmor relies on file system paths for access control rather than labels. Profiles specify allowed operations directly on file paths.

3. **Policy Abstractions**:
   AppArmor supports including common rules in multiple profiles using policy abstractions, improving policy maintainability.

##### Policy Language

AppArmor profiles are written in a straightforward policy language. Policies are stored in `/etc/apparmor.d/`. A basic profile includes:

- **Include Directives**: Include common policy fragments.

  ```c
  #include <tunables/global>
  ```

- **File Access Rules**: Specify what operations an application can perform on files.

  ```c
  /usr/bin/my_app {
      /usr/bin/my_app ix,
      /etc/my_app.conf r,
      /var/log/my_app.log w,
  }
  ```

- **Network Rules**: Define allowed network operations.

  ```c
  network inet tcp,
  network inet udp,
  ```

##### Using AppArmor

1. **Installation and Setup**:
   AppArmor is included in many distributions. Installation can be done via the package manager.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install apparmor apparmor-utils
   ```

2. **Configuring AppArmor**:
   AppArmor is configured in `/etc/apparmor.d/`. Profiles here dictate application confinement.

3. **Managing Profiles**:
   Profiles can be managed using command-line tools such as `aa-enforce` for setting profiles to enforce mode and `aa-complain` for setting profiles to complain mode.

   ```bash
   aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.my_app
   aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.my_app
   ```

4. **Creating Profiles**:
   AppArmor provides tools like `aa-genprof` and `aa-logprof` to help generate and refine profiles interactively.

   ```bash
   aa-genprof /usr/bin/my_app
   aa-logprof
   ```

5. **Troubleshooting**:
   AppArmor logs events in the system logs, typically found in `/var/log/syslog` or via `dmesg`. Violations can be reviewed and addressed using tools like `aa-complain` and `aa-logprof`.

   ```bash
   aa-logprof
   ```

##### Comparison of SELinux and AppArmor

While both SELinux and AppArmor serve the purpose of MAC in the Linux kernel, they differ fundamentally in various aspects:

1. **Configuration Complexity**:
   - SELinux: Offers fine-grained control but requires comprehensive understanding and significant administrative effort.
   - AppArmor: Easier to set up and manage, suitable for quick deployment.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - SELinux: Highly flexible with granular control over almost every aspect of access control.
   - AppArmor: Flexibility is limited to file and process controls, focusing on simplicity.

3. **Policy Management**:
   - SELinux: Uses a centralized policy management system with binary policy files.
   - AppArmor: Uses simpler, human-readable text policies, distributed across files.

4. **Ease of Use**:
   - SELinux: Steeper learning curve due to complexity.
   - AppArmor: More intuitive and user-friendly, especially for administrators with limited security expertise.

5. **Security Enforcement**:
   - SELinux: Stronger enforcement capabilities with robust type enforcement and multi-level security.
   - AppArmor: Effective for application confinement with path-based policies but less comprehensive than SELinux.

#### Conclusion

SELinux and AppArmor, while achieving the common goal of enhancing Linux security, offer different approaches suited to varying needs and administrative expertise. SELinux provides comprehensive, granular control suitable for environments requiring strict security policies, whereas AppArmor delivers an accessible and straightforward method to confine applications. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each can guide system administrators in deploying the most appropriate security mechanisms for their specific use cases. Through the strategic application of SELinux and AppArmor, Linux systems can be fortified against a broad spectrum of security threats, ensuring robust access control and system integrity.

### Secure Computing (seccomp)

#### Introduction

Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) is a powerful security feature in the Linux kernel that allows a process to restrict the system calls it can make. Introduced by Andrea Arcangeli and later expanded by Google, seccomp provides a mechanism for sandboxing applications, reducing their attack surface, and preventing them from performing unintended or harmful operations. This chapter delves into the architecture, functionality, configuration, and application of seccomp, offering a comprehensive understanding of its role in enhancing Linux security.

#### Historical Context

Initially, seccomp was proposed as a simple sandboxing mechanism that limited a process to only four system calls: `read()`, `write()`, `exit()`, and `sigreturn()`. This mode, known as "strict mode," was implemented in Linux 2.6.12. However, this limited functionality was not practical for most applications. To address this, seccomp-bpf was introduced in Linux 3.5, combining seccomp with the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) to provide more granular control over system calls. Seccomp-bpf allows developers to define custom filters that specify which system calls are permitted or denied, making it a versatile and powerful tool for application sandboxing.

#### Architecture and Design

The primary goal of seccomp is to minimize the potential impact of a compromised process by restricting its ability to invoke arbitrary system calls. Seccomp achieves this through the use of filters that evaluate system call numbers and their arguments, allowing or denying calls based on predefined rules.

##### Key Components

1. **Filters**:
   Seccomp filters are BPF programs that are attached to a process's system call entry point. These filters can inspect the system call number and arguments, making decisions based on predefined criteria.

2. **BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)**:
   BPF is a language originally designed for packet filtering in the network stack. Seccomp leverages BPF to create efficient and flexible filters for system call filtering. BPF programs are loaded into the kernel and executed in a virtual machine, providing a safe and powerful way to define security policies.

3. **Action Codes**:
   Seccomp filters can specify various actions to take when a system call matches a filter rule. The primary action codes include:
   - `SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW`: Allow the system call to proceed.
   - `SECCOMP_RET_DENY`: Block the system call, returning an error code to the caller.
   - `SECCOMP_RET_TRAP`: Generate a `SIGSYS` signal, allowing a custom signal handler to take action.
   - `SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO`: Return a specified error code without triggering a signal.
   - `SECCOMP_RET_TRACE`: Notify a tracing process (e.g., ptrace) to handle the system call.
   - `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`: Terminate the process.

##### Workflow

1. **Filter Creation**:
   A seccomp filter is created using BPF instructions. These filters are typically defined in user space and then installed into the kernel using the `prctl()` or `seccomp()` system calls.

2. **Filter Installation**:
   A process installs a seccomp filter by calling `seccomp()` or `prctl()` with the appropriate arguments. Once installed, the filter applies to all subsequent system calls made by the process.

   ```c
   seccomp(SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER, 0, &filter);
   ```

3. **System Call Interception**:
   When a system call is invoked, the seccomp filter is executed in the kernel. The filter evaluates the system call number and arguments, determining whether to allow, deny, or take another action.

4. **Action Handling**:
   Depending on the filter's decision, the kernel takes the specified action, such as allowing the system call, returning an error code, or sending a signal.

#### Using seccomp

1. **Installing Seccomp Filters**:
   Seccomp filters are typically installed by applications that need to sandbox themselves. For example, a web browser might use seccomp to restrict its render process to a minimal set of system calls.

   ```c++
   #include <linux/seccomp.h>
   #include <linux/filter.h>
   #include <unistd.h>
   #include <sys/prctl.h>
   #include <sys/syscall.h>

   // Define a seccomp filter
   struct sock_filter filter[] = {
       // Load the system call number into accumulator
       BPF_STMT(BPF_LD | BPF_W | BPF_ABS, offsetof(struct seccomp_data, nr)),
       // Allow read, write, and exit system calls
       BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP | BPF_JEQ | BPF_K, __NR_read, 0, 1),
       BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW),
       BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP | BPF_JEQ | BPF_K, __NR_write, 0, 1),
       BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW),
       BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP | BPF_JEQ | BPF_K, __NR_exit, 0, 1),
       BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW),
       // Deny all other system calls
       BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS),
   };

   struct sock_fprog prog = {
       .len = sizeof(filter) / sizeof(filter[0]),
       .filter = filter,
   };

   // Install the seccomp filter
   if (prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, &prog) == -1) {
       perror("prctl");
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }
   ```

2. **Seccomp and Containers**:
   Seccomp is commonly used in containerization platforms like Docker and Kubernetes to enhance security. Containers often run untrusted or minimally trusted code, making them ideal candidates for seccomp restriction. Docker, for example, provides default seccomp profiles that restrict containers to a subset of safe system calls.

   ```bash
   docker run --security-opt seccomp=default.json my_container
   ```

3. **Custom Seccomp Profiles**:
   Administrators can create custom seccomp profiles tailored to specific applications or workloads. These profiles define allowed and denied system calls, providing fine-grained control over application behavior.

   ```json
   {
       "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
       "syscalls": [
           {
               "names": ["read", "write", "exit", "sigreturn"],
               "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

4. **Seccomp in Programming Languages**:
   Many programming languages provide libraries or bindings to facilitate seccomp usage. For instance, in Python, the `pylibseccomp` library provides an interface for creating and installing seccomp filters.

   ```python
   import seccomp
   f = seccomp.Filter(seccomp.PR_TKILL)
   f.add_rule(seccomp.ALLOW, "read")
   f.add_rule(seccomp.ALLOW, "write")
   f.add_rule(seccomp.ALLOW, "exit")
   f.load()
   ```

#### Advantages and Limitations

##### Advantages

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**:
   By limiting a process to a minimal set of necessary system calls, seccomp reduces the attack surface, making it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.

2. **Minimal Performance Overhead**:
   Seccomp filters use BPF, which is optimized for performance. The overhead of seccomp is negligible in most cases, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.

3. **Granular Control**:
   Seccomp-bpf provides fine-grained control over system calls and their arguments, allowing tailored security policies for different applications.

4. **Ease of Integration**:
   Seccomp can be easily integrated into existing applications with minimal code changes. Many libraries and frameworks provide support for seccomp, simplifying its adoption.

##### Limitations

1. **Complexity**:
   Writing and maintaining seccomp filters can be complex, especially for applications with extensive system call requirements. Developers need to carefully analyze and understand the system calls used by their applications.

2. **Limited Coverage**:
   Seccomp filters only control system calls and their arguments. They do not provide comprehensive protection against other types of vulnerabilities, such as memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.

3. **Compatibility Issues**:
   Some applications may rely on a wide range of system calls, making it challenging to create restrictive seccomp profiles without impacting functionality. Ensuring compatibility with future kernel versions and system call changes can also be challenging.

4. **Signal Handling**:
   Using the `SECCOMP_RET_TRAP` action requires careful management of signal handlers, which can introduce additional complexity and potential race conditions.

#### Seccomp in Real-World Applications

1. **Web Browsers**:
   Modern web browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox, utilize seccomp to sandbox rendering and plugin processes. By restricting these processes to a minimal set of system calls, browsers mitigate the risk of exploitation from malicious web content.

2. **Containerization Platforms**:
   Container runtimes like Docker, runc, and CRI-O use seccomp to apply default and custom profiles to containers, ensuring that containerized applications cannot perform unauthorized actions on the host system.

3. **Microservices Architectures**:
   In microservices architectures, individual services can be sandboxed using seccomp to limit their capabilities and reduce the impact of potential security breaches. This isolation enhances the overall security posture of the system.

4. **High-Security Environments**:
   In environments requiring stringent security measures, such as financial institutions and government agencies, seccomp provides an additional layer of defense. Applications handling sensitive data can be confined to the minimal set of system calls necessary for their operation.

#### Conclusion

Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) is a critical security mechanism in the Linux kernel that enhances application isolation and reduces the attack surface. By allowing fine-grained control over system calls, seccomp provides a powerful tool for sandboxing applications, particularly in environments where untrusted or minimally trusted code is executed. Despite its complexity and limitations, seccomp is widely adopted in various real-world applications, including web browsers, containerization platforms, and high-security environments. Understanding and effectively leveraging seccomp can significantly enhance the security of Linux systems, providing robust protection against a wide range of threats.
