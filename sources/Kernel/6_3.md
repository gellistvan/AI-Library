## 19. Block Device Drivers

Chapter 19 dives into the fascinating world of Block Device Drivers. Unlike character device drivers, which handle data as a stream of bytes, block device drivers manage data in fixed-size chunks called blocks. This distinction is critical for high-performance storage systems, such as hard drives, SSDs, and other mass storage devices. In this chapter, we will unravel the three primary components that form the backbone of block device drivers: the Block Device Interface, which provides the abstraction for interacting with different types of block storage; the process of Implementing a Block Driver, where we translate this abstraction into functioning code; and the intricate mechanisms of Request Handling and Disk Scheduling, which ensure efficient data management and access. Whether you are looking to understand the architectural framework, to implement your own block driver, or to fine-tune the performance of your storage solutions, this chapter will equip you with the essential knowledge and practical insights to navigate the complex yet rewarding world of block device drivers.

### Block Device Interface

The Linux Kernel provides several highly optimized subsystems for managing hardware resources, and one crucial subsystem is the block device subsystem. The Block Device Interface (BDI) represents the low-level interface that abstracts block storage devices, handling data in fixed-size units called blocks. This interface allows various storage hardware—such as hard drives, solid-state drives, and USB drives—to interact with the rest of the system through a standardized API. This chapter will cover the architecture, key structures, functions, and the lifecycle of block devices in the Linux Kernel.

#### Architectural Overview

At the heart of the block device subsystem is the `block_device` structure encapsulated in the `linux/fs.h` header file. This structure, combined with ancillary structures like `gendisk` and `request_queue`, provides a detailed abstraction for block devices. Let's take a closer look at these key components:

1. **`struct block_device`**: This structure represents an individual block device, encapsulating details such as the device's state and the operations that can be executed on it.
2. **`struct gendisk`**: This structure represents an entire disk, encapsulating information about the disk as a whole, including its partitions.
3. **`struct request_queue`**: This structure manages the block I/O requests, maintaining queues for pending operations and ensuring they are dispatched efficiently.

#### `struct block_device`

The `block_device` structure is crucial for block device management. It includes multiple fields relevant to device state and control, but some critical fields include:

- **`dev_t bd_dev`**: Device number.
- **`struct inode *bd_inode`**: Inode representing the device file.
- **`struct super_block *bd_super`**: Filesystem superblock.
- **`unsigned long bd_block_size`**: Block size in bytes.
- **`struct gendisk *bd_disk`**: Associated gendisk structure.
- **`struct request_queue *bd_queue`**: Associated request queue.

Here's a simplified representation:

```C
struct block_device {
   dev_t bd_dev;
   struct inode *bd_inode;
   struct super_block *bd_super;
   unsigned long bd_block_size;
   struct gendisk *bd_disk;
   struct request_queue *bd_queue;
   // Other fields omitted for brevity
};
```

#### `struct gendisk`

The `gendisk` structure embodies the entire disk. Significant fields in this structure include:

- **`char disk_name[]`**: Name of the disk.
- **`int major`**: Major number of the device.
- **`int first_minor`**: First minor number of the device.
- **`struct request_queue *queue`**: Request queue associated with the disk.
- **`struct block_device_operations *fops`**: Operations associated with the disk.
- **`void *private_data`**: Device-specific data.
- **`int capacity`**: Capacity of the disk.

Here’s a snippet illustrating some of these fields:

```C
struct gendisk {
   char disk_name[32];
   int major;
   int first_minor;
   struct request_queue *queue;
   const struct block_device_operations *fops;
   void *private_data;
   int capacity;
   // Other fields omitted for brevity
};
```

#### `struct request_queue`

The request queue, represented by the `request_queue` structure, orchestrates the requests for block I/O operations. Key fields include:

- **`struct request_list rq`**: List of requests.
- **`spinlock_t queue_lock`**: Lock for synchronizing access to the queue.
- **`struct list_head queue_head`**: Head of the list of requests.
- **`void (*request_fn)(struct request_queue *)`**: Function pointer to process requests.

#### Initialization of the Block Device

Initialization of a block device involves several key steps, usually encapsulated in the device driver’s initialization routine. This starts with defining and allocating the relevant structures.

1. **Allocating `gendisk` Structure**:
   
   ```C
   struct gendisk *disk = alloc_disk(1);  // Allocates a gendisk structure for 1 partition.
   if (!disk) {
       // Error handling code
   }
   ```

2. **Setting up the Disk**:

   ```C
   snprintf(disk->disk_name, 32, "my_block_device");
   disk->major = MY_MAJOR_NUMBER;
   disk->first_minor = 0;
   disk->fops = &my_block_device_operations;
   disk->private_data = my_data_structure;
   ```

3. **Allocating and Setting up Request Queue**:

   ```C
   struct request_queue *queue = blk_init_queue(my_request_fn, &my_queue_lock);
   if (!queue) {
       // Error handling code
   }
   disk->queue = queue;
   ```

4. **Registering the Disk**:

   ```C
   add_disk(disk);
   ```

#### Block Device Operations

The operations associated with a block device are defined in the `block_device_operations` structure. Some crucial functions here include:

- **`int (*open)(struct block_device *, fmode_t)`**: Opens the device.
- **`void (*release)(struct gendisk *, fmode_t)`**: Releases the device.
- **`int (*ioctl)(struct block_device *, fmode_t, unsigned int, unsigned long)`**: Handles I/O control operations.
- **`int (*rw_page)(struct block_device *, sector_t, struct page *, int)`**: Reads/writes a single page.

Here’s a simplified illustration of the structure:

```C
struct block_device_operations {
   int (*open)(struct block_device *, fmode_t);
   void (*release)(struct gendisk *, fmode_t);
   int (*ioctl)(struct block_device *, fmode_t, unsigned int, unsigned long);
   int (*rw_page)(struct block_device *, sector_t, struct page *, int);
   // Other fields omitted for brevity
};
```

#### Request Handling

Request handling is a cornerstone of block device management and performance. The request queue contains all pending I/O operations, and the `request_fn` function processes these requests. 

1. **Adding a Request to the Queue**:

   ```C
   void add_request(struct request_queue *queue, struct request *req) {
       spin_lock_irqsave(&queue->queue_lock, flags);
       list_add_tail(&req->queuelist, &queue->queue_head);
       spin_unlock_irqrestore(&queue->queue_lock, flags);
   }
   ```

2. **Processing Requests**:

   ```C
   void my_request_fn(struct request_queue *q) {
       struct request *req;
       while ((req = blk_fetch_request(q)) != NULL) {
           // Process the request
           // End the request upon completion
           // blk_end_request_all(req, 0); // Indicates success
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Notification of Disk Change**:

   Sometimes it’s necessary to notify the kernel and user space about changes in the device status through the function `disk_update_events`.

   ```C
   disk_update_events(disk, DISK_EVENT_MEDIA_CHANGE, NULL);
   ```

#### Disk Scheduling

Disk scheduling is integral for optimizing I/O operations, balancing multiple requests effectively. The kernel offers various scheduling algorithms, including:

- **CFQ (Completely Fair Queuing)**: Distributes the available disk bandwidth evenly between processes.
- **Deadline**: Ensures no request waits too long by setting deadlines.
- **NOOP**: Implements a simple FIFO queue, mainly useful for devices with their own scheduling, like SSDs.

The administrator can change the scheduling policy dynamically using sysfs:

```shell
echo cfq > /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler
```

Alternatively, one can set the scheduler at boot time by adding the following to the kernel command line:

```text
elevator=cfq
```

#### Summary

The Block Device Interface in the Linux Kernel abstracts the complexities of various storage hardware, providing a robust and extensible framework for managing block devices. From defining critical structures like `block_device`, `gendisk`, and `request_queue` to implementing block device operations and handling I/O requests efficiently, the BDI is foundational for ensuring high-performance and reliable storage management. By understanding these intricacies, developers and system architects can effectively harness the power of block devices, optimizing both the hardware and software layers of the system.

### Implementing a Block Driver

Implementing a block driver in the Linux kernel involves a series of meticulous steps, from initializing kernel objects to managing data flows between the filesystem and hardware. This chapter will guide you through the comprehensive process of building a block driver with scientific rigor and a detail-oriented focus. We'll cover the architectural framework, key components, driver initialization, request handling, and integration with the kernel.

#### Architectural Framework

Before delving into the specifics of coding a block driver, it's essential to understand the architectural framework within which these drivers operate. The Linux block device layer sits between the filesystem and the hardware, providing a unified interface for storage devices.

1. **Device Registrations**: This involves registering the block device with the kernel and assigning it a major and minor number.
2. **Disk Initialization**: Setting up the `gendisk` structure, which represents the disk, and initializing the request queue.
3. **Request Handling**: Processing I/O requests coming from the filesystem and applications.
4. **Data Transfer**: Actual read and write operations to the hardware.

Let's break down each of these steps in detail.

#### Key Components

Several key components play pivotal roles in implementing a block driver:

- **`block_device_operations` structure**: Defines the set of operations that can be performed on the block device.
- **`gendisk` structure**: Represents the disk and its partitions.
- **`request_queue` structure**: Manages the queue of I/O requests for the device.
- **`bio` structure**: Represents block I/O operations.
- **Interrupt Handlers**: Handle hardware interrupts for read/write completions.

#### Driver Initialization

The first step in implementing a block driver is to initialize the critical components. Let's go through the initialization process systematically.

1. **Allocate and Register the Device Number**

   Allocate a major number and register the block device. This involves using functions like `register_blkdev`.

   ```C
   int major_number = register_blkdev(0, "my_block_device");
   if (major_number < 0) {
       printk(KERN_WARNING "Unable to register block device\n");
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

2. **Allocate and Initialize the `gendisk` Structure**

   The `gendisk` structure needs to be allocated and initialized:

   ```C
   struct gendisk *my_disk = alloc_disk(1);  // Allocate space for one partition
   if (!my_disk) {
       unregister_blkdev(major_number, "my_block_device");
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

3. **Initialize the Request Queue**

   The request queue is then initialized using `blk_init_queue`:

   ```C
   struct request_queue *my_queue = blk_init_queue(my_request_fn, &my_queue_lock);
   if (!my_queue) {
       put_disk(my_disk);
       unregister_blkdev(major_number, "my_block_device");
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

4. **Set Disk Properties**

   Set properties like the device's major and minor number, disk name, and operations:

   ```C
   snprintf(my_disk->disk_name, 32, "my_block_device");
   my_disk->major = major_number;
   my_disk->first_minor = 0;
   my_disk->fops = &my_block_device_operations;
   my_disk->queue = my_queue;
   ```

5. **Add the Disk**

   Finally, register the disk with the kernel using `add_disk`:

   ```C
   add_disk(my_disk);
   ```

#### Defining the `block_device_operations` Structure

The `block_device_operations` structure defines the set of operations applicable to the block device. Critical operations include:

- **`open`**: Opens the block device.
- **`release`**: Closes the block device.
- **`ioctl`**: Handles I/O control operations.
- **`media_changed`**: Checks if the media has changed (relevant for removable media).
- **`revalidate_disk`**: Revalidates the disk.

Here is an example:

```C
static const struct block_device_operations my_block_device_operations = {
   .owner = THIS_MODULE,
   .open = my_block_device_open,
   .release = my_block_device_release,
   .ioctl = my_block_device_ioctl,
   .media_changed = my_block_device_media_changed,
   .revalidate_disk = my_block_device_revalidate,
};
```

Each function can be implemented to handle specific tasks. For example, the `open` function might increment a counter to keep track of the number of times the device is accessed.

#### Request Handling

Request handling is a critical component of block device drivers. Requests are encapsulated in the `request_queue` structure and processed by a request function.

1. **Processing Requests**

   The request function processes requests from the request queue. This function typically runs in a loop, fetching and executing requests.

   ```C
   static void my_request_fn(struct request_queue *q) {
       struct request *req;

       while ((req = blk_fetch_request(q)) != NULL) {
           if (blk_rq_is_passthrough(req)) {
               // Unsupported request type
               printk(KERN_NOTICE "Skip non-fs request\n");
               blk_end_request_all(req, -EIO);
               continue;
           }

           // Handle other request types like READ/WRITE
           if (req->cmd_flags & REQ_OP_READ) {
               // Perform read operation
           } else if (req->cmd_flags & REQ_OP_WRITE) {
               // Perform write operation
           }

           // Indicate completion
           blk_end_request_all(req, 0); // 0 indicates success
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Handling Read and Write Operations**

   The actual read and write operations involve transferring data between the buffer and the storage medium.

   - **Read Operation**: Fetch data from the hardware, place it into the buffer, and mark the request as completed.
   - **Write Operation**: Fetch data from the buffer, write it to the hardware, and mark the request as completed.

3. **Interrupt Handling**

   For some devices, data transfer operations are interrupted-driven. Interrupt handlers need to be registered for handling completion interrupts:

   ```C
   static irqreturn_t my_interrupt_handler(int irq, void *dev_id) {
       // Acknowledge the interrupt
       // Complete the data transfer
       // Wake up any waiting processes
       return IRQ_HANDLED;
   }
   ```

   Register the interrupt handler:

   ```C
   if (request_irq(my_device_irq, my_interrupt_handler, IRQF_SHARED, "my_block_device", my_device)) {
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

#### Data Structures

Understanding the key data structures in block drivers is essential:

- **`bio` structure**: Represents block I/O operations. A `bio` structure describes a segment of I/O to be transferred.

  ```C
  struct bio {
      sector_t bi_sector;   // Start sector
      struct bio_vec *bi_io_vec;  // Vector of buffers
      unsigned int bi_vcnt; // Number of buffers in vector
      // Other fields
  };
  ```

- **`request` structure**: Represents a complete block request, which can involve multiple `bio` structures.

  ```C
  struct request {
      struct list_head queuelist;  // List structure
      struct bio *bio;             // Pointer to the associated bio
      // Other fields
  };
  ```

#### Error Handling and Cleanup

Error handling is crucial throughout the initialization, request processing, and cleanup stages. Ensure proper cleanup in case of errors:

1. **Releasing Resources**

   If an error occurs during initialization, ensure all allocated resources are appropriately released:

   ```C
   if (queue) {
       blk_cleanup_queue(queue);
   }
   if (disk) {
       put_disk(disk);
   }
   unregister_blkdev(major_number, "my_block_device");
   ```

2. **Handling Request Errors**

   During request handling, handle errors gracefully:

   ```C
   static void my_request_fn(struct request_queue *q) {
       struct request *req;

       while ((req = blk_fetch_request(q)) != NULL) {
           if (blk_rq_is_passthrough(req)) {
               printk(KERN_NOTICE "Skip non-fs request\n");
               blk_end_request_all(req, -EIO);  // Error on unsupported requests
               continue;
           }

           // Handle read/write operations
           // On error:
           blk_end_request_all(req, -EIO);  // Indicate error
       }
   }
   ```

#### Testing and Debugging

Testing and debugging are essential to ensure the driver works correctly. Use tools like `dd`, `blkid`, and `hdparm` for testing block devices.

1. **Basic Testing with `dd`**

   ```bash
   sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/my_block_device bs=1M count=10
   sudo dd if=/dev/my_block_device of=/dev/null bs=1M count=10
   ```

2. **Check Device Information with `blkid`**

   ```bash
   sudo blkid -p /dev/my_block_device
   ```

3. **Measure Performance with `hdparm`**

   ```bash
   sudo hdparm -tT /dev/my_block_device
   ```

4. **Debugging with `printk`**

   Use `printk` statements liberally to log information during development. Remember to remove or reduce verbosity in production code.

   ```C
   printk(KERN_INFO "Block device opened\n");
   ```

#### Summary

Implementing a block driver in the Linux kernel involves a comprehensive understanding of kernel structures, device initialization, and request handling. Through careful planning and systematic implementation, one can create efficient and robust block device drivers. Proper error handling and thorough testing ensure reliability and performance, making this a critical component of a stable Unix-like operating system. By mastering these intricacies, developers can greatly enhance their skills and contribute to the open-source community or their proprietary systems with high-quality storage solutions.

### Request Handling and Disk Scheduling

The efficiency and responsiveness of a block device driver are heavily influenced by how it handles I/O requests and schedules disk operations. This chapter delves into the complex mechanisms of request handling and disk scheduling in the Linux kernel, providing a thorough understanding of how to manage and optimize these processes. This includes an overview of request handling, the data structures involved, the lifecycle of a request, and the various disk scheduling algorithms employed by the kernel.

#### 1. Request Handling Overview

Request handling in the Linux kernel involves managing block I/O requests from higher-level subsystems, like filesystems and user applications, and translating these into concrete hardware operations. The goal is to ensure efficient and timely data transfers, minimizing latencies and maximizing throughput.

**Key Objectives:**

- **Queue Management**: Maintaining a queue of pending I/O requests.
- **Batching and Merging**: Combining similar requests to reduce overhead.
- **Prioritization**: Ensuring critical operations are processed promptly.
- **Completion Handling**: Notifying the higher subsystem of the operation's completion.

#### 2. Data Structures in Request Handling

Several key data structures facilitate request handling in the Linux kernel, each serving a specific role in the lifecycle of a request.

- **`request_queue`**: Manages the queue of pending I/O requests.
- **`request`**: Represents an individual I/O request.
- **`bio` (Block I/O)**: Describes block I/O operations, encapsulating aspects like data buffers and the range of sectors involved.
- **`elevator_queue`**: Manages the scheduling of requests within the context of a specific scheduling algorithm.

**Example Structure:**

```C
struct request {
   struct list_head queuelist;  // Linked list of requests
   struct request_queue *q;  // Associated request queue
   struct bio *bio;  // Pointer to the associated bio
   unsigned long cmd_flags;  // Flags indicating request type
   // Other fields
};
```

**`bio` Structure:**

```C
struct bio {
   sector_t bi_sector;  // Starting sector for the I/O
   struct bio_vec *bi_io_vec;  // Vector of data buffers
   unsigned int bi_vcnt;  // Number of entries in the vector
   unsigned int bi_idx;  // Current index in the vector
   // Other fields
};
```

#### 3. Lifecycle of a Request

The lifecycle of a request in the Linux kernel can be divided into several distinct stages: creation, insertion into the queue, dispatch, and completion.

**1. Request Creation:**

Requests are generated by the block I/O layer through functions like `blk_queue_bio`. A `bio` structure is created to encapsulate the I/O operation details.

```C
int blk_queue_bio(struct request_queue *q, struct bio *bio) {
   // Logic to create and queue request
   return 0;  // Return 0 on success
}
```

**2. Queue Insertion:**

Once created, the request is inserted into the request queue. Depending on the scheduling algorithm, it may be placed at different positions within the queue.

**3. Request Dispatch:**

Requests are dispatched from the queue to the block device driver by the `request_fn` function. This function processes the requests, performing the actual read or write operations.

```C
void my_request_fn(struct request_queue *q) {
   struct request *req;

   while ((req = blk_fetch_request(q)) != NULL) {
      // Process the request
      // Perform read/write operations
      blk_end_request_all(req, 0); // Indicate completion
   }
}
```

**4. Completion Handling:**

Once a request is processed, completion handlers are invoked to notify the kernel and user space of the request's status. Functions like `blk_end_request_all` are used to indicate completion.

**Interrupt Handling:**

Interrupts play a crucial role in request completion, especially for hardware-accelerated operations. The interrupt handler acknowledges the completion and performs cleanup tasks.

```C
irqreturn_t my_interrupt_handler(int irq, void *dev_id) {
   // Acknowledge interrupt
   // Complete the request
   return IRQ_HANDLED;
}
```

#### 4. Disk Scheduling Algorithms

Disk scheduling algorithms are pivotal in optimizing the order and timing of I/O requests. The Linux kernel provides multiple disk scheduling algorithms, each with distinct characteristics suited to different workloads.

**1. CFQ (Completely Fair Queuing):**

CFQ aims to provide balanced I/O bandwidth distribution among processes by grouping requests per process and equalizing access.

- **Implementation**: CFQ maintains per-process queues and services them in a round-robin manner.
- **Pros**: Fair bandwidth distribution, suitable for multi-user environments.
- **Cons**: Can induce additional latencies for high-performance applications.

**2. Deadline Scheduler:**

The Deadline scheduler prioritizes requests based on deadlines to ensure no request waits too long.

- **Implementation**: Maintains two queues—one sorted by deadline and the other by request sector. Requests are serviced from the deadline queue if any request is close to its deadline.
- **Pros**: Prevents starvation of requests, suitable for real-time systems.
- **Cons**: May not fully optimize throughput.

**3. NOOP (No-Operation Scheduler):**

NOOP is a simple FIFO queue useful for devices like SSDs that manage their own scheduling.

- **Implementation**: Maintains a straightforward queue, dispatching requests in the order they arrive.
- **Pros**: Minimal overhead, ideal for storage devices with internal scheduling capabilities.
- **Cons**: Poor performance on traditional spinning disks.

**4. BFQ (Budget Fair Queuing):**

BFQ provides a more fine-grained control over request distribution, focusing on providing guarantees and fairness both in terms of bandwidth and latency.

- **Implementation**: Uses budgets to allocate I/O resources to requests, ensuring fair distribution.
- **Pros**: Highly customizable, suitable for interactive workloads and storage with mixed request patterns.
- **Cons**: Higher complexity than other schedulers.

#### 5. Configuring and Tuning Disk Schedulers

Administrators can configure and tune disk schedulers dynamically using sysfs and kernel parameters.

**Dynamic Configuration Using sysfs:**

```bash
# List available schedulers
cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler

# Set a scheduler
echo cfq > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
```

**Setting Scheduler at Boot Time:**

Add the following parameter to the kernel boot command line:

```text
elevator=cfq
```

**Scheduler Tuning Parameters:**

Schedulers expose various parameters for fine-tuning. These can be adjusted via sysfs:

```bash
# Example: Tuning CFQ parameters
echo 100 > /sys/block/sda/queue/iosched/slice_idle
echo 8 > /sys/block/sda/queue/nr_requests
```

Different schedulers expose different parameters, and careful tuning can significantly impact performance.

#### 6. Advanced Topics in Request Handling

**Request Merging:**

The kernel can merge contiguous requests to optimize I/O operations:

```C
static int bio_mergeable(struct bio *a, struct bio *b) {
   // Logic to determine if bios can be merged
   return 1;  // Return 1 if mergeable, 0 otherwise
}
```

**Elevator Algorithms:**

Elevator algorithms, used within schedulers, determine the order of request servicing:

- **LOOK**: Elevator-like algorithm that services requests in a single direction until no requests remain, then reverses.
- **SCAN**: Similar to LOOK, but processes requests in both directions.

**Real-Time Constraints:**

Real-time systems may require deterministic I/O handling, necessitating specific scheduler configurations or custom implementations.

**QoS (Quality of Service):**

Implementing QoS policies ensures that critical applications receive necessary bandwidth and latency guarantees.

#### Summary

Request handling and disk scheduling are critical components in the performance and responsiveness of block device drivers. By understanding the intricacies of request lifecycle management, from creation to completion, and the impact of various scheduling algorithms, one can optimize the performance of block devices to meet specific workload requirements. Tuning and configuring disk schedulers dynamically allows further refinements to achieve desired performance characteristics, ensuring that both user and system demands are met effectively. Mastering these aspects enhances the ability to develop, maintain, and optimize robust block device drivers within the Linux kernel.
