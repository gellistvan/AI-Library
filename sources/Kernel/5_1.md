# Part V: File Systems

## 13. VFS (Virtual File System)

In the complex ecosystem of the Linux kernel, the Virtual File System (VFS) serves as a critical abstraction layer between the user-space and the various file systems supported by the kernel. This chapter delves deep into the architecture and fundamental data structures of the VFS, elucidating how it provides a uniform interface for different file systems, be they ext4, NFS, or even a custom-designed one. By exploring the process of filesystem registration and mounting, we reveal how the kernel dynamically incorporates diverse file systems into a cohesive structure. Additionally, we examine the intricacies of file operations and inodes, the backbone entities that manage file metadata and enable efficient file access. This understanding is vital for anyone looking to unravel the complexities of Linux file system operations or aspiring to contribute to kernel development by extending or optimizing filesystem support.

### VFS Architecture and Data Structures

The Virtual File System (VFS) is a pivotal component of the Linux kernel, playing an indispensable role in bridging the considerable variety of filesystems it supports, without exposing the underlying complexity to user-space applications. By providing a common interface, the VFS simplifies file operations, making them consistent regardless of the filesystem in use. To understand the VFS in its entirety, it's essential to delve into its architecture and the key data structures that underpin its functionality.

#### Introduction to VFS Architecture

At a high level, the VFS serves as an abstraction layer that takes user-space system calls related to file operations and translates them into filesystem-specific operations. This is achieved through a series of well-defined interfaces and data structures. The core elements of the VFS architecture include:

- **Superblock**: Represents a mounted filesystem, containing metadata specific to the filesystem instance.
- **Inode**: Represents an individual file within a filesystem.
- **Dentry (Directory Entry)**: Represents a single component of a pathname, providing caching and linking between inodes.
- **File**: Represents an open file, linking the file descriptor in user-space to the corresponding inode.

Each of these structures encapsulates various attributes and pointers to filesystem-specific methods. By standardizing these structures, the VFS can accommodate any filesystem that conforms to its interface.

#### Superblock Object

The superblock object encapsulates the metadata about a filesystem. Each mounted filesystem has an associated superblock, represented by the `struct super_block`.

```c
struct super_block {
   struct list_head s_list;            // List of all superblocks
   dev_t s_dev;                        // Identifier for the device
   unsigned long s_blocksize;          // Block size
   struct dentry *s_root;              // Root directory dentry
   struct super_operations *s_op;      // Superblock operations
   ...
};
```

**Key Fields Explained**:

- `s_list`: Links all superblocks in a kernel-wide list.
- `s_dev`: Identifies the device associated with the filesystem.
- `s_blocksize`: Specifies the block size used by the filesystem.
- `s_root`: Points to the root `dentry` of this filesystem.
- `s_op`: Points to the `super_operations` structure, containing pointers to methods for operations such as reading inodes, writing superblocks, syncing data, etc.

**Superblock Operations** (`super_operations`):

The `super_operations` structure defines functions that perform operations on superblocks.

```c
struct super_operations {
   void (*write_inode) (struct inode *, int);
   void (*evict_inode) (struct inode *);
   void (*put_super) (struct super_block *);
   ...
};
```

#### Inode Object

An inode is a data structure that stores information about a file within a filesystem. In Linux, inodes are represented by the `struct inode`.

```c
struct inode {
   umode_t i_mode;                   // File mode (permissions)
   unsigned short i_opflags;         // Inode operation flags
   struct super_block *i_sb;         // Pointer to associated superblock
   struct file_operations *i_fop;    // File operations
   struct inode_operations *i_op;    // Inode operations
   struct timespec i_mtime;          // Modification time
   ...
};
```

**Key Fields Explained**:

- `i_mode`: Indicates the file mode and permissions.
- `i_sb`: Points to the superblock object of the filesystem containing this inode.
- `i_fop`: Points to the file operations structure, `file_operations`.
- `i_op`: Points to the inode operations structure, `inode_operations`.
- `i_mtime`: Stores the last modification time of the file.

**Inode Operations** (`inode_operations`):

The `inode_operations` structure defines functions specific to inode operations.

```c
struct inode_operations {
   int (*create) (struct inode *, struct dentry *,
                   umode_t, bool);
   struct dentry* (*lookup) (struct inode *, 
                       struct dentry *, 
                       unsigned int);
   int (*link) (struct dentry *, struct inode *, 
                 struct dentry *);
   ...
};
```

#### Dentry Object

A dentry (directory entry) represents a single component of a filesystem path. Dentaries are organized in a tree structure, linking directory components to their corresponding inodes.

```c
struct dentry {
   unsigned int d_flags;                // Dentry flags
   unsigned char d_iname[NAME_MAX];      // Entry name
   struct inode *d_inode;               // Associated inode (if any)
   struct dentry_operations *d_op;      // Dentry operations
   struct super_block *d_sb;            // Superblock pointer
   struct dentry *d_parent;             // Parent directory
   struct list_head d_subdirs;          // Subdirectories
   struct list_head d_child;            // Link to sibling
   ...
};
```

**Key Fields Explained**:

- `d_flags`: Flags for the dentry.
- `d_iname`: Name of the dentry.
- `d_inode`: Points to the associated inode if such exists.
- `d_op`: Points to the dentry operations structure, `dentry_operations`.
- `d_sb`: Points to the associated superblock.
- `d_parent`: Points to the parent dentry, enabling hierarchical structure.
- `d_subdirs` and `d_child`: Link subdirectories within the directory tree.

**Dentry Operations** (`dentry_operations`):

The `dentry_operations` structure defines functions specific to dentry operations.

```c
struct dentry_operations {
   int (*d_revalidate) (struct dentry *, unsigned int);
   int (*d_hash) (const struct dentry *, 
                   struct qstr *);
   int (*d_compare) (const struct dentry *, 
                      const struct dentry *,
                      unsigned int, const char *,
                      const struct qstr *);
   ...
};
```

#### File Object

A file object represents an open file in a process context. It links the file descriptor in user-space to the corresponding inode and provides the context for file operations.

```c
struct file {
   struct path f_path;                    // Filesystem path
   struct inode *f_inode;                 // Pointer to associated inode
   const struct file_operations *f_op;    // File operations
   ...
};
```

**Key Fields Explained**:

- `f_path`: Represents the filesystem path to the file.
- `f_inode`: Points to the associated inode.
- `f_op`: Points to the file operations structure, `file_operations`.

**File Operations** (`file_operations`):

The `file_operations` structure defines functions for file-specific actions such as reading, writing, and seeking.

```c
struct file_operations {
   ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char __user *, 
                     size_t, loff_t *);
   ssize_t (*write) (struct file *, const char __user *, 
                      size_t, loff_t *);
   int (*open) (struct inode *, struct file *);
   int (*release) (struct inode *, struct file *);
   ...
};
```

#### Conclusion

Understanding the Virtual File System (VFS) in Linux is not merely an academic exercise; it is fundamental to appreciating how the Linux kernel abstracts the diverse array of filesystems it supports, enabling seamless file operations. By delving into the architecture and key data structures such as superblocks, inodes, dentries, and files, and recognizing their associated operations, we garner a comprehensive view of the VFS's design and its role in filesystem management. This detailed scrutiny equips us with the knowledge necessary to extend, optimize, and innovate within the realm of Linux filesystems effectively.

### Filesystem Registration and Mounting

The process of registering and mounting filesystems in the Linux kernel is both intricate and crucial for the proper functioning of the operating system. It allows the kernel to recognize and manage different types of filesystems dynamically, facilitating a robust and extensible storage subsystem. This chapter delves into the sophisticated mechanisms behind filesystem registration and mounting, shedding light on the underlying principles, data structures, and key functions involved.

Registration of filesystems in the Linux kernel involves implementing the required methods defined in the VFS interface structures and registering these implementations with the kernel using the `register_filesystem` function.

When a filesystem is registered, it usually involves defining the superblock, inode operations, dentry operations, and file operations, among other structures. Here's a conceptual look at the steps involved:

1. **Define Filesystem-Specific Operations**: Implement the filesystem-specific `super_operations`, `inode_operations`, `dentry_operations`, and `file_operations`.

2. **Register the Filesystem**:

   ```c
   struct file_system_type my_fs_type = {
      .name = "myfs",
      .mount = myfs_mount,
      .kill_sb = kill_block_super,
      ...,
   };

   int init_my_filesystem(void) {
      return register_filesystem(&my_fs_type);
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Mount Function**: The mount function typically reads the superblock from the underlying device and sets up the necessary structures.

   ```c
   static struct dentry *myfs_mount(struct file_system_type *fs_type,
                  int flags, const char *dev_name,
                  void *data) {
      return mount_bdev(fs_type, flags, dev_name,
               data, myfs_fill_super);
   }

   int myfs_fill_super(struct super_block *sb, void *data, 
                  int silent) {
      // Fill superblock here
   }
   ```

#### Filesystem Registration

Filesystem registration is the procedure through which a filesystem type is made known to the kernel. This enables the kernel to invoke the filesystem-specific code when performing file operations on that filesystem. Registration typically involves defining and initializing a `file_system_type` structure and then invoking the `register_filesystem` function.

##### File System Type Structure

The `file_system_type` structure is a fundamental data structure that describes a filesystem and holds pointers to the methods used by the kernel to interact with the filesystem.

```c
struct file_system_type {
     const char *name;                               // Filesystem name
     int fs_flags;                                   // Filesystem flags
     struct dentry *(*mount) (struct file_system_type *fs_type,
                      int flags, const char *dev_name,
                      void *data);            // Mount function
     void (*kill_sb) (struct super_block *);         // Function to release the superblock
     struct module *owner;                           // Pointer to the module
     struct file_system_type * next;                 // Pointer to the next filesystem
};
```

**Key Fields Explained**:

- `name`: The name of the filesystem (e.g., "ext4").
- `fs_flags`: Flags defining properties of the filesystem (e.g., `FS_REQUIRES_DEV`).
- `mount`: A pointer to the function responsible for mounting the filesystem.
- `kill_sb`: A pointer to the function that is invoked to release the superblock when the filesystem is unmounted.
- `owner`: Identifies the module that implements the filesystem.
- `next`: Points to the next filesystem in the list of registered filesystems.

##### Registering a Filesystem

To register a filesystem, the `register_filesystem` function is called with a pointer to the `file_system_type` structure. On successful registration, the filesystem gets added to the kernel's list of known filesystems.

```c
int init_myfs(void) {
   static struct file_system_type myfs_type = {
      .name = "myfs",
      .mount = myfs_mount,
      .kill_sb = kill_block_super,
      .owner = THIS_MODULE,
   };
   return register_filesystem(&myfs_type);
}
```

##### Unregistering a Filesystem

When a filesystem is no longer needed, or before unloading a kernel module, it is essential to unregister the filesystem to clean up resources. This is done using the `unregister_filesystem` function.

```c
void exit_myfs(void) {
   unregister_filesystem(&myfs_type);
}
```

#### Filesystem Mounting

Mounting is the process of making a filesystem accessible to the system by attaching it to a specified directory (mount point) within the existing directory structure. This involves several steps: invoking the filesystem's `mount` function, reading the filesystem's superblock, and preparing the necessary in-memory structures.

##### Mount Function (Entry Point)

The `mount` function, specified in the `file_system_type` structure, serves as the entry point for the mounting process. This function is responsible for setting up the superblock and the root directory of the filesystem.

```c
static struct dentry *myfs_mount(struct file_system_type *fs_type,
               int flags, const char *dev_name,
               void *data) {
   return mount_bdev(fs_type, flags, dev_name, data, myfs_fill_super);
}
```

##### Reading the Superblock and Filling Structures

The helper function `mount_bdev` (or similar helpers, depending on the type of filesystem) typically calls another function, such as `myfs_fill_super`, to read the superblock and initialize it along with other essential structures.

```c
int myfs_fill_super(struct super_block *sb, void *data, int silent) {
   // Fill superblock with filesystem-specific initialization
   struct inode *root_inode;
   root_inode = new_inode(sb);
   // Initialize root inode
   sb->s_root = d_make_root(root_inode);
   if (!sb->s_root)
      return -ENOMEM;
   return 0;
}
```

##### Mounting Mechanism

The mounting mechanism ties together various components to establish a cohesive relationship between the kernel’s VFS layer and the specific filesystem.

1. **Invoke the `mount` function**: When a mount request is made (e.g., using the `mount` system call or the `mount` command), the kernel first locates the appropriate `file_system_type` structure from the list of registered filesystems based on the filesystem type specified in the request.

2. **Setup Superblock**: The `mount` function creates a new superblock, initializes it by reading the on-disk superblock, and sets up in-core data structures like inodes and dentries.

3. **Establish Root Dentry**: A root dentry for the filesystem is created, linking it with the in-core root inode.

4. **Update VFS Structures**: The VFS updates its internal structures, linking the newly created mount point into the global namespace, thus making the filesystem accessible.

##### Example: Ext4 Mount Procedure

Using the widely-used ext4 filesystem as an illustrative example, we explore the general procedure involved in mounting.

1. **ext4_mount**:
   The entry point is the `ext4_mount` function, defined in the ext4's `file_system_type` structure.
   ```c
   static struct dentry *ext4_mount(struct file_system_type *fs_type, 
                       int flags, const char *dev_name,
                       void *data) {
       return mount_bdev(fs_type, flags, dev_name, data, ext4_fill_super);
   }
   ```

2. **ext4_fill_super**:
   This function reads the ext4 superblock from the disk and fills the `super_block` structure.
   ```c
   int ext4_fill_super(struct super_block *sb, void *data, int silent) {
       struct ext4_sb_info *sbi = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ext4_sb_info), GFP_KERNEL);
       if (!sbi)
           return -ENOMEM;

       // Read on-disk superblock
       sb_set_blocksize(sb, EXT4_MIN_BLOCK_SIZE);
       if (!read_superblock())
           return -EINVAL;
       
       // Initialize superblock in-core structures
       sb->s_magic = EXT4_SUPER_MAGIC;
       sb->s_op = &ext4_sops;
       sb->s_root = d_make_root(ext4_iget(sb, EXT4_ROOT_INO));
       
       if  (IS_ERR(sb->s_root))
           return PTR_ERR(sb->s_root);
       
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **ext4_sops**:
   The `super_operations` structure allows for specific superblock operations for the ext4 filesystem.

4. **ext4_iget**:
   Retrieves the inode corresponding to the root directory of the ext4 filesystem and sets it as the root dentry.

##### Filesystem Mounting Options

Mounting a filesystem can be customized through various flags and options, providing flexibility in handling different scenarios.

- **Mount Flags**: Flags such as `MS_RDONLY` for read-only mounts, `MS_NOEXEC` for disallowing binary execution, and `MS_SYNCHRONOUS` for synchronous writes offer control over access permissions and behavior.

- **Mount Options**: Filesystem-specific options (e.g., `noatime`, `nodiratime` for disabling access time updates) can be passed during mounting, influencing performance and functionality.

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/myfs
mount -t myfs -o noatime /dev/sda1 /mnt/myfs
```

#### Unmounting Filesystems

Unmounting, through the `umount` system call or `umount` command, detaches a filesystem from the directory tree, ensuring all pending operations are completed and resources are cleaned up.

```bash
umount /mnt/myfs
```

**Steps Involved**:

1. **Sync Data**: Ensure all data is written back to storage.
2. **Release Dentries and Inodes**: Free up associated dentries and inodes.
3. **Invoke kill_sb**: Call the `kill_sb` function to release the superblock.

#### Conclusion

Filesystem registration and mounting in Linux are sophisticated processes that require a deep understanding of the VFS layer and its interaction with specific filesystem implementations. By meticulously registering filesystems and carefully orchestrating the mounting process, Linux achieves an elegant abstraction that supports a diverse array of filesystems, ensures high performance, and maintains system integrity. This level of detail and scientific rigor allows both system developers and administrators to effectively manage and extend filesystem capabilities within the Linux environment.

### File Operations and Inodes

File operations and inodes are at the heart of the Linux filesystem. These constructs form the cornerstone of how the kernel interacts with files and directories, enabling efficient file management, access control, and metadata handling. This chapter delves deeply into the architecture, underlying data structures, and critical functions that define file operations and inodes, providing a comprehensive understanding of their roles within the Linux VFS layer.

File operations encompass a wide range of activities that can be performed on files, including reading, writing, creating, deleting, linking, and more. As mentioned earlier, these operations are defined in the `file_operations` structure and implemented in the associated filesystem driver.

Each open file is represented by a `file` structure, which points to the relevant `inode` structure containing metadata about the file. Inodes serve as the cornerstone for file attributes and filesystem-specific information.

For example, when a file is read:

1. A file descriptor is obtained from the user-space application.
2. The kernel looks up the corresponding `file` structure using the file descriptor.
3. The `file` structure points to an inode via the `f_inode` field.
4. The VFS uses the `file_operations->read` method associated with the file to perform the read operation, ensuring that the actual data is retrieved as per the underlying filesystem's specifics.

```c
ssize_t myfs_read(struct file *filp, char __user *buf, 
                  size_t len, loff_t *offset) {
   struct inode *inode = filp->f_inode;
   // Implementation specific to myfs
}
```

#### Introduction to Inodes

An inode (index node) is a fundamental data structure in Unix-like operating systems that stores information about a file or a directory. In Linux, inodes encapsulate metadata about files and directories, such as file permissions, ownership, size, and pointers to data blocks.

##### Inode Structure

The inode structure, represented by `struct inode` in the Linux kernel, is defined in `<linux/fs.h>`. It consists of various fields that describe different aspects of a file.

```c
struct inode {
   umode_t i_mode;                         // File mode (permissions)
   unsigned short i_opflags;               // Inode operation flags
   struct super_block *i_sb;               // Associated superblock
   struct address_space *i_mapping;        // Pointer to memory mapping
   struct file_operations *i_fop;          // File operations
   struct inode_operations *i_op;          // Inode operations
   struct timespec i_atime;                // Access time
   struct timespec i_mtime;                // Modification time
   struct timespec i_ctime;                // Change time
   loff_t i_size;                          // Size of inode (file size)
   atomic_t i_count;                       // Usage count
   struct list_head i_dentry;              // List of dentries pointing to this inode
   ...
};
```

**Key Fields Explained**:

- `i_mode`: Specifies the file type and permissions (e.g., regular file, directory, symlink).
- `i_opflags`: Operation flags for the inode.
- `i_sb`: Points to the superblock of the filesystem containing this inode.
- `i_mapping`: Used for managing memory-mapped files.
- `i_fop`: Points to the file operations structure (`file_operations`).
- `i_op`: Points to the inode operations structure (`inode_operations`).
- `i_atime`, `i_mtime`, `i_ctime`: Timestamps for access, modification, and change events.
- `i_size`: The size of the file.
- `i_count`: Usage count, tracking how many references exist to this inode.
- `i_dentry`: List of dentries, enabling efficient access to directory entries associated with this inode.

##### Inode Operations (`inode_operations`)

The `inode_operations` structure defines methods specific to inode actions. Each method corresponds to a filesystem-specific implementation, allowing the VFS to interact uniformly with diverse filesystems.

```c
struct inode_operations {
   int (*create) (struct inode *, struct dentry *, umode_t, bool);
   struct dentry* (*lookup) (struct inode *, struct dentry *, unsigned int);
   int (*link) (struct dentry *, struct inode *, struct dentry *);
   int (*unlink) (struct inode *, struct dentry *);
   int (*symlink) (struct inode *, struct dentry *, const char *);
   int (*mkdir) (struct inode *, struct dentry *, umode_t);
   int (*rmdir) (struct inode *, struct dentry *);
   ...
};
```

**Key Methods Explained**:

- `create`: Creates a new file.
- `lookup`: Resolves a directory entry.
- `link`: Creates a hard link to a file.
- `unlink`: Deletes a file.
- `symlink`: Creates a symbolic link.
- `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
- `rmdir`: Removes a directory.

#### File Operations

File operations encompass the actions performed on files and are defined by the `file_operations` structure. This structure enables a filesystem to specify its implementations for various file-related actions.

##### File Structure

When a file is opened, the kernel creates a `struct file` object to represent the open file within the process context. This structure links the file descriptor in user-space to the corresponding inode and holds the context for file operations.

```c
struct file {
   struct path f_path;                    // Filesystem path
   struct inode *f_inode;                 // Pointer to associated inode
   const struct file_operations *f_op;    // File operations
   void *private_data;                    // Filesystem private data
   ...
};
```

**Key Fields Explained**:

- `f_path`: Represents the filesystem path to the file.
- `f_inode`: Points to the inode object associated with the file.
- `f_op`: Points to the file operations structure (`file_operations`).
- `private_data`: Used by filesystems to associate private data with the file instance.

##### File Operations (`file_operations`)

The `file_operations` structure includes pointers to functions that define how file-related actions, such as read, write, open, and close, are executed.

```c
struct file_operations {
   ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
   ssize_t (*write) (struct file *, const char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
   int (*open) (struct inode *, struct file *);
   int (*release) (struct inode *, struct file *);
   loff_t (*llseek) (struct file *, loff_t, int);
   int (*ioctl) (struct inode *, struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);
   int (*mmap) (struct file *, struct vm_area_struct *);
   int (*flush) (struct file *, fl_owner_t id);
   int (*fsync) (struct file *, struct dentry *, int datasync);
   ...
};
```

**Key Methods Explained**:

- `read`: Reads data from a file into a user-space buffer.
- `write`: Writes data to a file from a user-space buffer.
- `open`: Opens a file.
- `release`: Closes a file.
- `llseek`: Moves the file pointer to a specified location.
- `ioctl`: Performs device-specific input/output operations.
- `mmap`: Maps a file into the memory space of the process.
- `flush`: Flushes any state before releasing the file.
- `fsync`: Synchronizes file data with storage.

#### Interplay Between Inodes and File Operations

The interplay between inodes and file operations is crucial for the functioning of filesystems in Linux. When a file operation is invoked, the kernel uses the inode associated with the file to determine the file's attributes and the specific methods to execute.

##### Opening a File: An Example

When a process opens a file, the VFS performs the following steps:

1. **Path Resolution**:
   The kernel resolves the file path by traversing the directory tree, consulting dentry and inode objects.

2. **Retrieving the Inode**:
   Upon reaching the target file, the kernel retrieves the inode associated with the file.

3. **Allocating File Structure**:
   The kernel allocates and initializes a `struct file` object, linking it to the retrieved inode and populating the `f_op` field with the appropriate `file_operations`.

4. **Invoking the Open Method**:
   The kernel calls the `open` method from the `file_operations`, allowing the filesystem to perform any necessary setup.

```c
int myfs_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp) {
   // Perform necessary setup for file opening
   return 0;
}
```

#### Reading from a File: An Example

When a process reads from a file, the VFS takes the following steps:

1. **Finding the File Structure**:
   The kernel finds the `struct file` object corresponding to the file descriptor.

2. **Invoking the Read Method**:
   The kernel calls the `read` method from the `file_operations`.

3. **Performing the Read**:
   The filesystem-specific `read` method reads the data from the file based on the inode information and populates the user-space buffer.

```c
ssize_t myfs_read(struct file *filp, char __user *buf, size_t len, loff_t *offset) {
   struct inode *inode = filp->f_inode;
   // Read data from inode and copy to user buffer
   return len;
}
```

#### Writing to a File: An Example

When a process writes to a file, the VFS follows a similar approach:

1. **Finding the File Structure**:
   The kernel looks up the `struct file` object.

2. **Invoking the Write Method**:
   The kernel calls the `write` method from the `file_operations`.

3. **Performing the Write**:
   The filesystem-specific `write` method writes the data from the user-space buffer to the file, updating the inode's metadata as necessary.

```c
ssize_t myfs_write(struct file *filp, const char __user *buf, size_t len, loff_t *offset) {
   struct inode *inode = filp->f_inode;
   // Write data from user buffer to inode
   return len;
}
```

#### Advanced Inode Features

Inodes in Linux support various advanced features to enhance performance, security, and functionality.

#### Extended Attributes

Extended attributes (xattrs) allow filesystems to associate additional metadata with files and directories. These metadata can include security labels, user-defined attributes, and system attributes.

- **Setting xattrs**: The `setxattr` method sets a named attribute on an inode.
  
- **Getting xattrs**: The `getxattr` method retrieves a named attribute's value.

#### Inode Cache

To optimize filesystem performance, the kernel employs an inode cache, reducing the overhead of repeatedly reading inodes from storage. The cache holds recently used inodes and reclaims them using LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithms.

- **Reclaiming Inodes**: The inode cache periodically reclaims unused inodes to free memory.
  
- **Accessing Cached Inodes**: The `iget` function retrieves an inode from the cache or reads it from storage if not present.

#### Inode Numbers (i-numbers)

Each inode is uniquely identified by an inode number (i-number), which remains constant for the life of the filesystem. This number allows the kernel to quickly locate and manage inodes.

- **Root Inode**: The root directory of a filesystem has a reserved i-number (typically 2 for ext4).

#### Conclusion

Inodes and file operations are integral components of the Linux VFS, enabling efficient and flexible file management. Through detailed data structures and well-defined methods, inodes encapsulate file metadata while file operations dictate how files are accessed and manipulated. By understanding these elements and their interplay, we gain profound insights into the inner workings of the Linux filesystem, empowering us to develop, debug, and optimize filesystem implementations with scientific rigor and precision.
