## 29. Access Control and Capabilities 

In the complex ecosystem of the Linux kernel, securing resources and ensuring that they are accessed only by authorized entities is paramount. This chapter delves into the critical mechanisms used to manage and enforce access control. We will begin with the traditional UNIX permission model, a cornerstone of security in UNIX-like systems, which uses user, group, and others' permissions to control access. Moving beyond these foundational concepts, we will explore Access Control Lists (ACLs), which provide more granular and flexible permission management. Finally, we will examine POSIX capabilities, an advanced feature that allows fine-tuned delegation of specific privileges to processes, thereby enhancing security by minimizing the need for all-encompassing root privileges. Through understanding these mechanisms, we gain insights into how Linux maintains robust security while ensuring flexibility and control in managing system resources.

### Traditional UNIX Permissions

Traditional UNIX permissions form the bedrock of security in UNIX and UNIX-like systems, including Linux. Established early in the development of UNIX, this permission model is foundational to understanding more advanced security mechanisms in modern systems. This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of traditional UNIX permissions, covering their structure, operational principles, and nuances to offer a comprehensive understanding.

#### 1. Overview of Traditional UNIX Permissions

UNIX permissions are designed to control access to filesystem objects (files and directories) using a straightforward model involving three types of entities and three types of permissions:

- **Entities**:
  - **User**: The owner of the file.
  - **Group**: A set of users grouped together.
  - **Others**: All other users on the system.

- **Permissions**:
  - **Read (r)**: Permission to read the content of the file.
  - **Write (w)**: Permission to modify or delete the file.
  - **Execute (x)**: Permission to execute the file, applicable for scripts and binaries.

Each file or directory has an associated set of these permissions, structured in a triplet format, often represented as `rwxrwxrwx`. This triplet can be understood as three sets of `rwx` permissions corresponding to the user, group, and others, respectively.

#### 2. File Mode Representation

File permissions are represented using a 10-character string, with the first character indicating the file type and the remaining nine characters representing permission bits.

Example of file mode: `-rwxr-xr--`

- **File Type**: The first character could be:
  - `-`: Regular file
  - `d`: Directory
  - `l`: Symbolic link
  - Additional types include `c` for character device, `b` for block device, etc.

- **Permission Bits**: The subsequent characters are grouped in sets of three:
  - The first set corresponds to the user permissions.
  - The second set corresponds to group permissions.
  - The third set corresponds to others' permissions.

In the example `-rwxr-xr--`:
- User (owner) has read, write, and execute permissions (`rwx`).
- Group has read and execute permissions (`r-x`).
- Others have read-only permissions (`r--`).

#### 3. Numeric Representation of Permissions

Permissions can also be represented numerically using octal (base-8) notation. Each permission type (read, write, execute) is assigned a specific value:

- Read (r) = 4
- Write (w) = 2
- Execute (x) = 1

The permissions for user, group, and others are summed to form a three-digit octal number. For instance:

- `rwx` (read, write, execute) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
- `rw-` (read, write) = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6
- `r--` (read only) = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4

Using the previous example `-rwxr-xr--`, the octal representation would be `755`:
- User: `rwx` = 7
- Group: `r-x` = 5
- Others: `r--` = 4

This representation is particularly convenient for setting permissions using commands like `chmod`.

#### 4. Permission Management Commands

Several commands are pivotal for managing UNIX permissions:

- **ls**: Lists the files in a directory along with their permissions.
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```

- **chmod**: Changes the file mode (permissions) of a file or directory.
  ```bash
  chmod 755 filename
  ```

- **chown**: Changes ownership of a file or directory to a different user and/or group.
  ```bash
  chown user:group filename
  ```

- **chgrp**: Changes the group ownership of a file or directory.
  ```bash
  chgrp groupname filename
  ```

Each command facilitates specific aspects of permission management, ensuring controlled access to files and directories.

#### 5. Special Permission Bits

Beyond the basic read, write, and execute permissions, traditional UNIX permissions include special permission bits that provide additional functionality:

- **Setuid**: When set on an executable file, the process runs with the privileges of the file's owner (user ID), rather than the executing user.
  - Represented numerically: `4---`.
  - Example: `chmod 4755 filename`.

- **Setgid**: When set on an executable file, the process runs with the privileges of the file's group ID. When set on a directory, new files created within the directory inherit the group ID of the directory.
  - Represented numerically: `2---`.
  - Example: `chmod 2755 dirname`.

- **Sticky Bit**: When set on a directory, it restricts file deletion; only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or the root user can delete files within that directory.
  - Represented numerically: `1---`.
  - Example: `chmod 1755 dirname`.

These special bits enhance the flexibility and security of file access management.

#### 6. Permission Checks and Effective IDs

The Linux kernel performs permission checks at various points, typically during file open and execution system calls. The check evaluates whether the requesting entity (user or process) has the necessary permissions:

- **UID and GID**: Each process has an associated User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID). These IDs are used to enforce access controls.
  - Real UID (RUID): The actual user ID of the user who started the process.
  - Effective UID (EUID): The user ID used by the kernel to determine the process's access rights.
  - Real GID (RGID) and Effective GID (EGID) follow a similar pattern for groups.

When a process attempts to access a file, the kernel checks the file's mode against the process's EUID and EGID. If a permission denial occurs, an `EPERM` (Operation not permitted) or `EACCES` (Permission denied) error is returned.

#### 7. Security Implications and Best Practices

Traditional UNIX permissions offer simplicity but also come with limitations, particularly in large, multi-user environments:

- **Least Privilege Principle**: Users should only have the minimum necessary permissions. This minimizes the risk of accidental or malicious damage.
- **Regular Audits**: Regularly review and audit file permissions to prevent privilege escalation.
- **Combination with ACLs**: For more granular control, consider using Access Control Lists (ACLs) alongside traditional UNIX permissions.

For security-critical applications, special attention should be given to setuid and setgid bits to prevent privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

#### 8. Advanced Topics

While traditional UNIX permissions provide a solid framework, modern systems often require more flexibility. This section briefly touches on how traditional permissions interact with:

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: ACLs extend traditional permissions by allowing more granular user and group permissions.
- **POSIX Capabilities**: Capabilities break down the all-encompassing root privileges into distinct units, improving security.

Understanding traditional UNIX permissions is crucial before delving into these advanced topics, as they build on the foundational concepts discussed in this chapter.

#### Conclusion

Traditional UNIX permissions are a fundamental aspect of UNIX-like systems, providing a clear and efficient model for access control. Through understanding the basics, numeric representation, commands, special bits, and security implications, one gains comprehensive insights into this key security mechanism. As we move forward to explore more advanced features like ACLs and POSIX capabilities, the principles of traditional UNIX permissions will remain central to our understanding and management of system security.

This detailed understanding ensures robust security practices, enabling administrators and developers to create, manage, and maintain secure systems in an increasingly complex computing environment.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide a more flexible and granular permission mechanism than traditional UNIX permissions. They are particularly useful in complex environments where the UNIX model of user/group/others is not sufficiently expressive. ACLs allow permissions to be set for multiple users and groups individually, enabling fine-tuned access control tailored to the needs of the system and its users.

#### 1. Introduction to ACLs

ACLs extend the basic UNIX permission model by allowing the specification of different permissions for different users and groups on a per-file or per-directory basis. An ACL consists of a series of entries known as Access Control Entries (ACEs), each of which specifies a set of permissions for a user or group.

#### 2. Structure of an ACL

An ACL for a file or directory includes several types of entries:

- **User ACLs**:
  - **Owner User**: The file's owner.
  - **Named Users**: Specific users other than the file's owner.

- **Group ACLs**:
  - **Owning Group**: The group associated with the file.
  - **Named Groups**: Specific groups other than the owning group.

- **Mask**: Specifies the maximum effective permissions for all entries except the owner and others. It acts as a ceiling on permissions for named users, owning group, and named groups.

- **Other**: Permissions for users not covered by any other ACEs in the ACL.

Each ACE specifies the entity (user or group) and the permissions that apply (read, write, execute).

#### 3. Understanding ACL Entries

An ACL entry typically takes the form:
```
[user|group|other]:[name|]:perms
```
- **Type**: Specifies whether the ACL entry applies to a user, group, or others.
- **Name**: The name of the specific user or group (optional for owner user, owning group, and others).
- **Perms**: The permission set, which could be a combination of read (r), write (w), and execute (x).

Example ACL entries:
```
user::rwx                 # Owner user permissions
user:alice:r--            # Specific user permissions
group::r-x                # Owning group's permissions
group:staff:rw-           # Specific group permissions
mask::rwx                 # Mask entry
other::r--                # Others' permissions
```

#### 4. Managing ACLs

To manage ACLs on a file system that supports them (such as ext3, ext4, XFS), specialized utilities are used.

##### 4.1 Viewing ACLs

The `getfacl` command is used to display the ACLs associated with a file or directory.
```bash
getfacl filename
```
This command outputs the ACLs, including the traditional UNIX permissions.

##### 4.2 Modifying ACLs

The `setfacl` command is used to set and modify ACLs. It can add, modify, or remove ACL entries for a file or directory.

Adding an entry:
```bash
setfacl -m u:alice:rw filename
```
This adds an ACE giving the user `alice` read and write permissions on the specified file.

Removing an entry:
```bash
setfacl -x u:alice filename
```
This removes the ACE for the user `alice`.

##### 4.3 Copying ACLs

ACLs can be copied from one file to another using the `getfacl` and `setfacl` commands:

```bash
getfacl source_file | setfacl --set-file=- target_file
```

##### 4.4 Default ACLs

Default ACLs can be set on directories to be inherited by new files and subdirectories created within them. This simplifies permission management for directories.

Setting a default ACL:
```bash
setfacl -d -m u:john:rwX directory
```
This sets a default ACL entry for the user `john` on the specified directory, giving `john` read, write, and execute permissions for all new files and directories.

#### 5. ACL Mask and Effective Permissions

The mask entry in an ACL is essential for controlling the maximum permissions that can be granted to users and groups, excluding the owner and others. It acts as a filter that limits the permissions specified in the individual ACL entries.

Calculating effective permissions involves considering the union of the traditional UNIX permissions and the ACL entries, limited by the mask. This ensures that no ACE can grant permissions exceeding the mask.

Example:
If the mask is set to `r-x`, and a named user entry grants `rwx`, the effective permissions for that user will be limited to `r-x`.

#### 6. Advantages and Use Cases of ACLs

ACLs offer several advantages over traditional UNIX permissions:

- **Granularity**: They allow specific permissions for multiple users and groups, providing fine-tuned access control.
- **Flexibility**: Default ACLs facilitate the seamless inheritance of permissions in directories.
- **Complex Environments**: ACLs are well-suited for environments with complex access control requirements, such as collaborative projects or shared resources in enterprises.

##### 6.1 Use Cases

- **Shared Directories**: Multiple users and groups requiring different levels of access to the same set of files.
- **Departmental Structures**: Organizations with hierarchical structures can manage access more effectively with ACLs.
- **Project Collaboration**: Teams working on collaborative projects can use ACLs to ensure proper access without interfering with each other’s files.

#### 7. Security Implications and Best Practices

#### 7.1 Security Considerations

ACLs provide enhanced security features but must be managed carefully:

- **Complexity**: The increased flexibility can lead to more complex permission sets, making it harder to audit.
- **Mask Management**: Proper management of mask entries is crucial to prevent unintended access permissions.
- **Consistency**: Regular reviews and consistency checks are essential to maintain a secure and manageable permissions structure.

#### 7.2 Best Practices

- **Limit Use**: Use ACLs only where traditional UNIX permissions are insufficient. This simplifies permission management.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of ACLs to ensure consistency and detect potential security issues.
- **Automate Management**: Use scripts and tools to automate the management of ACLs, particularly for large-scale environments.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of permission structures to assist with audits and troubleshooting.

#### 8. Advanced Topics and Integration

While ACLs are powerful on their own, they are often used in combination with other security features:

- **Integrated Security Policies**: Combine ACLs with security frameworks like SELinux for enhanced control.
- **Networked Filesystems**: Use ACLs on networked filesystems like NFS to maintain consistent permissions across distributed environments.
- **Audit Logging**: Implement audit logging to track changes to ACLs and monitor access patterns.

#### Conclusion

Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide a flexible and detailed approach to permission management, extending the capabilities of traditional UNIX permissions. Through understanding their structure, management, and security implications, one can effectively leverage ACLs to meet the complex access control requirements of modern computing environments. Proper use of ACLs, combined with best practices and regular audits, ensures robust and manageable security in both simple and intricate scenarios. As we move towards even more advanced security features, a solid grasp of ACLs forms a critical part of a comprehensive security strategy, enabling administrators and developers to tailor access controls to the nuanced needs of their systems and users.

### POSIX Capabilities

POSIX capabilities are a sophisticated security feature designed to address the limitations of the traditional superuser model in UNIX-like systems. By breaking down the all-encompassing root privileges into smaller, more manageable units, capabilities offer granular control over the actions a process can perform, enhancing security by adhering to the principle of least privilege.

#### 1. Introduction to POSIX Capabilities

In traditional UNIX systems, the root user (UID 0) possesses unrestricted access to the system, a setup that poses significant security risks. Mistakes or vulnerabilities in processes running with root privileges can lead to system-wide compromises. POSIX capabilities mitigate this risk by dividing root privileges into distinct, independent units that can be applied to processes without granting full root access.

Capabilities allow processes to perform specific privileged operations while restricting others, minimizing the attack surface and potential damage from security breaches.

#### 2. Capability Model and Structure

POSIX capabilities are defined as a set of distinct privileges that can be independently enabled or disabled for each process. The Linux kernel defines several capabilities, each corresponding to a particular privileged operation.

##### 2.1 Capability Definitions

Capabilities are designated by names prefixed with `CAP_`. Some common capabilities include:

- `CAP_CHOWN`: Change file ownership (chown).
- `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`: Bypass file read, write, and execute permission checks.
- `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`: Bypass file read permission checks.
- `CAP_FOWNER`: Bypass discretionary access control restrictions.
- `CAP_NET_ADMIN`: Perform network-related operations (e.g., interface configuration).
- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`: Perform a wide range of system administration tasks.
- `CAP_SYS_TIME`: Modify the system clock.

A complete list is available in the Linux capabilities man page (`man 7 capabilities`).

##### 2.2 Capability Sets

Processes have three primary capability sets:

- **Permitted**: The capabilities that a process may use.
- **Inheritable**: The capabilities that can be inherited by executed child processes.
- **Effective**: The currently active capabilities of the process.

There is also a **bounding set**, which limits the capabilities that a process and its descendants can acquire.

#### 3. Manipulating POSIX Capabilities

Capabilities can be managed using specific system calls and utilities. Understanding how to manipulate capabilities is crucial for effectively using them to enhance security.

##### 3.1 System Calls

Several system calls directly interact with POSIX capabilities:

- `capget()`: Retrieves the capability sets of a process.
- `capset()`: Sets the capability sets of a process.

Example in C:
```c++
#include <sys/capability.h>
#include <linux/capability.h>

struct __user_cap_header_struct cap_header;
struct __user_cap_data_struct cap_data;

cap_header.version = _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3;
cap_header.pid = getpid();

cap_data.permitted = (1 << CAP_NET_ADMIN);  // Grant CAP_NET_ADMIN
cap_data.effective = cap_data.permitted;

if (capset(&cap_header, &cap_data) < 0) {
   perror("capset()");
   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```
This code snippet grants the calling process the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.

##### 3.2 Utilities

- **getcap**: Displays the capabilities of a file.
  ```bash
  getcap /path/to/executable
  ```

- **setcap**: Sets the capabilities of a file.
  ```bash
  setcap cap_net_admin+ep /path/to/executable
  ```

- **capsh**: A shell wrapper for capability operations, useful for debugging and testing.
  ```bash
  capsh --caps="cap_net_admin+ep" -- -c 'your_command'
  ```

- **libcap**: A library that provides interfaces for manipulating capabilities.

```python
# Example in Python using subprocess
import subprocess

def set_capability(file_path, capability):
   subprocess.call(['setcap', capability, file_path])

set_capability('/path/to/executable', 'cap_net_admin+ep')
```

##### 3.3 Capability Inheritance

Capabilities can be inherited by child processes, but certain conditions must be met:

- The capabilities must exist in both the inheritable and permitted sets of the parent process.
- Executable files must be marked with `inheritable` capabilities using `elfctl`.

```bash
setcap 'cap_net_admin+ei' /path/to/executable
```

In this example, the executable will inherit `CAP_NET_ADMIN`.

#### 4. Secure Usage of Capabilities

Properly managing capabilities is essential to maximizing their security benefits while minimizing risks.

##### 4.1 Principle of Least Privilege

Grant only the minimum necessary capabilities to each process. Do not use general capabilities when specific ones suffice:
```bash
setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=ep' /usr/sbin/httpd
```
This grants the minimum capability required for a web server to bind to privileged ports.

##### 4.2 Capability Dropping

Processes should drop capabilities as soon as they are no longer needed to mitigate the risk of privilege escalation:
```c++
#include <sys/prctl.h>
#include <linux/capability.h>

void drop_capabilities() {
   if (prctl(PR_CAPBSET_DROP, CAP_SYS_ADMIN, 0, 0, 0) < 0) {
      perror("prctl(PR_CAPBSET_DROP)");
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }
}
```
This function drops the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability.

##### 4.3 Capability Bounding Set

Restrict the bounding set to prevent processes from acquiring unnecessary capabilities later:
```bash
sysctl -w kernel.cap_bound=cap_net_admin,cap_chown,cap_fowner
```
This restricts the capabilities that any process on the system can acquire.

##### 4.4 File Capabilities

When setting capabilities on executables, understand that they affect how the executable is run by any user:
```bash
setcap 'cap_dac_override=ep' /usr/bin/special_command
```
Use with caution to avoid inadvertently increasing the attack surface.

#### 5. Advanced Topics

##### 5.1 Capability-Aware Applications

Applications can be made capability-aware, allowing them to change their own capabilities dynamically:
```c++
#include <sys/capability.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void adjust_capabilities() {
   cap_t caps = cap_get_proc();
   cap_value_t cap_list[] = {CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE};

   cap_set_flag(caps, CAP_EFFECTIVE, 1, cap_list, CAP_SET);
   if (cap_set_proc(caps) == -1) {
      perror("cap_set_proc");
   }
   cap_free(caps);
}
```
This increases the application’s control over its own privileges.

##### 5.2 SELinux Integration

POSIX capabilities can be combined with SELinux to enforce fine-grained security policies. SELinux contexts can specify capabilities to further constrain processes’ actions.

##### 5.3 Kernel Namespaces

Namespaces in Linux allow isolating resources such as process IDs, network interfaces, and mount points. Capabilities work effectively within namespaces, providing additional security layers in containerized environments:
```c++
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <sched.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   pid_t child_pid = clone(child_func, stack + STACK_SIZE, SIGCHLD | CLONE_NEWNET, NULL);
   waitpid(child_pid, NULL, 0);
   return 0;
}

int child_func(void *arg) {
   sethostname("new_namespace", 12);
   return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `CLONE_NEWNET` flag ensures the child process has its own network namespace.

#### Conclusion

POSIX capabilities offer a powerful mechanism for enhancing the security of UNIX-like systems. By breaking down root’s all-encompassing privileges into discrete units, capabilities provide finer control over the actions processes can perform, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Understanding and effectively managing POSIX capabilities, from theoretical concepts to practical implementation, is crucial for administrators and developers to build secure and robust environments.

The ability to dynamically adjust capabilities, integrate with other security frameworks like SELinux, and work within containerized architectures makes POSIX capabilities a versatile and indispensable tool in the modern security landscape. Through meticulous application, regular audits, and adherence to best practices, capabilities can significantly mitigate risks associated with privileged operations, contributing to resilient and secure systems.
